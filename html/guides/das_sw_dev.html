<H2><A NAME="P1.0">1.0</A>: Summary</H2>

This manual includes discussion of arcane issues which I hope are 
of interest only to fulltime programmers. If subjects listed here 
become of interest to experimenters, they should probably be 
reworked for general disemination.<P>

<H2><A NAME="P2.0">2.0</A>: Writing Instrument Startup Scripts</H2>

Instrument startup scripts (e.g. interact, runfile) are one of the
last areas of arcane knowledge to be automated. I will jot down
some of the issues involved in writing these scripts. Generally
a startup script includes some of the following:<P>

<PRE>        memo
        cmdctrl
        dccc
        scdc
        timerbd
        &lt;collection&gt;
        soldrv
        nav
        lgr
        bfr
        indexer
        &lt;command server&gt;
        &lt;display programs&gt;
        &lt;algorithms&gt;
        &lt;command client (keyboard interface)&gt;
</PRE>

Each of these programs requires a number of command-line options.
The order of operations is significant,
since certain programs expect other programs to be already present
when they are initialized. If program A talks to a program B,
program B must be run first, and there must be an intervening
<TT>namewait</TT>
call to verify that program B has completed its initialization.
The following rules will attempt to define the interrelations.<P>

Every program talks to <TT>memo,</TT> hence it should come first.<P>

<TT>dccc, scdc, soldrv</TT> and <TT>nav</TT> register with
<TT>cmdctrl,</TT> hence it should come before they do.
Collection and <TT>indexer</TT> will register with
<TT>cmdctrl</TT> if it is present, so they should come
later also.<P>

Collection will use <TT>timerbd</TT> if it is present,
so collection should come after <TT>timerbd.</TT><P>

<TT>soldrv, nav, lgr, bfr, indexer,</TT>
the command server, display programs and algorithms all talk to
collection during initialization, so they must start later.<P>

If a <TT>.slp</TT> format is used, the command server will need
to talk to <TT>soldrv</TT> during initialization also, so the
command server must start later.<P>

Display programs and algorithms are generally placed on the
<TT>bfr</TT> rather than directly on the ring to avoid
interference with collection, hence <TT>bfr</TT>
should be present and preceed these programs.<P>

Algorithms which start telemetry should be as close to the end
of the script as possible to allow any other programs to finish
their initialization before the system gets into full swing.<P>

Programs which display data (and any TMC-generated program can,
even collection!) may require special handling, particularly if
more than one screen is involved.<P>

If the command client is present, it is usually the first of
these programs to run in the foreground. When it terminates,
it is assumed the entire script should terminate.<P>

<H2><A NAME="P3.0">3.0</A>: What Programs will you Need to Generate?</H2>

In general, you will need to provide programs for Data Acquisition 
(collection and display), Data Analysis (extraction) and 
instrument control (command client/server, algorithms). You have 
considerable latitude as to how these are combined or divided. 
I will use as an example an experiment known as the Extra Proton 
detector, for which the acronym "abc" will be used. Throughout
this document, wherever the letters
<TT>abc</TT>
are used in a filename, you would substitute the acronym for your
own experiment. The following is a likely list of executable files
required to run abc:<P>

<DL COMPACT>
  <DT>abccol
  <DD>Collection
  <DT>abcdisp
  <DD>Full-screen Display
  <DT>abcext
  <DD>Spreadsheet Extraction
  <DT>abcsrvr
  <DD>Command Server
  <DT>abcclt
  <DD>Command Client
  <DT>abcalgo
  <DD>Command Algorithm
  <DT>abc.dccc
  <DD>DCCC pin definition file
  <DT>abc.sft
  <DD>Compiled Solenoid Cycle definition
</DL>

Of course your experiment may require more than one display, 
extraction, algorithm or solenoid definition, but these are the 
basic pieces we use to run experiments.<P>

<H2><A NAME="P4.0">4.0</A>: TMC Source Files</H2>

Your best bet when defining a new instrument (and the approach I always
use) is to refer to the definition of another instrument. The "usual
sources" required by TMC consist of the following:<P>

<DL>
<DT>types.tmc
<DD>Defines data types and conversions.
<DT>abc.tmc
<DD>Defines type and rate for each telemetry datum.
<DT>abcgrp.tmc
<DD>Group definitions if required
<DT>abccol.tmc
<DD>Definitions specific to collection
<DT>abc.fld
<DD>.Ref scrdes
<DD>screen definition
<DT>abc.edf
<DD>Spreadsheet extraction definition
<DT>abc.tma
<DD>.Ref tmcalgo
<DD>algorithm
<DT>abc.cyc
<DD>Solenoid cycle calculation definition
</DL>

Not all of these files will be required by every experiment. Furthermore,
some experiments use other source files, particularly if sources
are generated automatically by agenda.
