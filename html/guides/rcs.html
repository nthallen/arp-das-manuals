<H1>Introduction to Revision Control</H1>

<P>Revision control is a means of recording incremental steps in the
development of software or other text-based documents. By using
revision control, it becomes possible to undo changes that have
been made if the changes prove to be untenable. It can also provide
a means to limit who can modify particular files as well as to
identify who made a particular change.</P>

<P>This is potentially very useful in the development of
instrument software where there are multiple developers who may
be working in physically removed locations. Up until the present,
we have operated in an environment where control of the source
code was maintained entirely by word-of-mouth and not enforced by
the operating system. The individuals working on an instrument
would agree on who should be working on a particular file at a
particular time. As it happens, that approach was largely
successful, but there was little in the way of record keeping. If
any source code was checked in, it was usually by Norton, and
there was no record of who actually editted the software.</P>

<P>As part of an effort to provide somewhat more comprehensive
documentation of the software for instruments, I would like to
promote the use of revision control. The implications are as
follows:

<UL>
<LI>By default, you will not have write permissions on any source
files. In order to obtain write permission, you will have to
obtain a lock on the current revision of the file using the
<A HREF="/usr/help/product/qnx423/utils/co.html">co</A> utility.
If a lock is currently held by another user, your lock request
will be denied, and you will be told who currently has the file
locked. You then need to <I>talk</I> to that person in order to
arbitrate control of the file.<HR>

<LI>After you make your changes and test them, you should check
in your changes and unlock the file using the
<A HREF="/usr/help/product/qnx423/utils/ci.html">ci</A> utility.
Among other things, you can specify the current <B>state</B> of
the file with the <B>-s</B> option.<HR>

<LI>If you create a new source file (such as a .edf file), you
should check it in at your earliest convenience, making sure to
provide a useful description for the file.
