<H2><A NAME="P0">0</A>: Welcome and Introduction</H2>

Welcome to the Atmospheric Research Project (ARP) Data Acquisition
Systems. This is a large body of software designed to provide
powerful, flexible, extensible and efficient data acquisition and
control to a wide range of scientific instruments.<P>

This guide is intended to outline what you need to know in order
to operate your instrument. It assumes some knowledge of computer
systems in general and QNX in particular. If you feel you are
missing some of this background, you are invited to review the
"QNX System Architecture" and "QNX User's Guide" which provide
a fairly comprehensive overview. Your resident experts will also
be happy to answer your questions to help you get up to speed.<P>

For starters, you will need to have a QNX account in order to be
able to login. If you don't already have one, see your system
administrators to request one.<P>

<H2><A NAME="P1">1</A>: Basic Setup</H2>

Your instrument is operated via one or more computers which are 
interconnected by a computer network. If you are using more than 
one computer, only one is directly connected to the instrument 
and will be referred to as the "flight computer". (It is called
this even if your instrument has never or will never fly. Maybe
that's wishful thinking, maybe just stupidity, but that's what
we call it!) Any other computers are used to display data and/or
control the instrument and are called the "Ground Support 
Equipment" or GSE.<P>

If your instrument actually does fly, the flight computer will 
need to be able to operate when separated from the network, so it 
will have its own hard disk (or other mass storage device) with 
its own copy of the instrument software. The GSE will also need 
its own hard disk and copy of the software, since it must operate 
independently during pre-flight operations. In some cases, a 
lab-based flight computer can be configured to run without its 
own hard disk.<P>

In a two-computer two-disk configuration, the instrument should 
have a "home directory" on the GSE and another home directory
on the flight computer. The home directory contains all the
special software required to operate the instrument. As a rule,
you will operate the instrument from the home directory on the
GSE. If the home directory is <TT>/home/abc</TT>, you will type:
<PRE>
        cd /home/abc
</PRE>

<H2><A NAME="P2">2</A>: Running an Instrument</H2>

The command to start up the instrument is <TT>doit</TT>. (On
some instruments there is more than one "doit" command with
slightly different names.)  Entering this command will
begin the process of starting up the instrument. It may
take 20-30 seconds for the instrument to initialize, as there
are many different programs which must be loaded. Once the
initialization is complete, you should be presented with a
data screen and a command line. (If not, advance to
<A HREF="#P8">Troubleshooting</A>.)<P>

Your instrument may or may not begin taking data immediately. If
not, you will have to issue the command "Telemetry Start". Once
data acquisition has begun, you should be able to see the minor
frame counter (MFCtr) counting and other channels updating.<P>

Telemetry Start is one of a group of basic commands incorporated
into every instrument. These include:

<DL>
<DT>Telemetry Start
<DD>Begins data acquisition.
<DT>Telemetry Logging Suspend
<DD>If the lgr is running, this instructs it to stop writing data
to disk files. If issued before Telemetry Start, no log files
will be created.
<DT>Telemetry Logging Resume
<DD>If the lgr is running, this instructs it to resume writing 
data to disk files.
<DT>Quit
<DD>Terminates data acquisition and requests all instrument
software processes to shut down.
<DT>Exit
<DD>Shuts down GSE operations without affecting data acquisition.
This command may not be present on your instrument.
<DT>IOMODE n
<DD>Affects how the command line behaves. The details are
described below under <A HREF="#P2.2">IOMODE</A>
</DL>

<H3><A NAME="P2.1">2.1</A>: Shutting Down</H3>

Now that you have all the balls in the air, you need to know how
to bring them down gracefully. While turning off the power is
usually quite effective at terminating operations, it is almost
certain to result in corruption of your hard disk's file system
unless you have completed a proper shutdown first. There are
two ending commands which are quite different and deserve
special mention.<P>

<H4><A NAME="P2.1.1">2.1.1</A>: Quit</H4>

Quit is the total shutdown command. It not only shuts down your
command and data display, but it also shuts down all the data
acquisition and control programs on the flight computer and any
other display or algorithm programs running elsewhere on the
network. This is the command which must be issued before the
flight computer can be safely powered down.

<H4><A NAME="P2.1.2">2.1.2</A>: Exit: Just the GSE</H4>

Exit, in contrast, makes no requests at all of the flight 
computer, but simply shuts down local GSE operations. It is
possible to shut down your GSE in order to do some other
operation, and then start it up again with <TT>doit</TT>
without ever terminating the data acquisition on the flight
computer.<P>

If you have more than one GSE console running, or you have an
algorithm running which issues a Quit command, the flight
computer's data acquisition may shutdown before you shutdown your
GSE. In this case, your GSE should also shut down gracefully with
the system. If it doesn't, you may need to issue an Exit command.
Issuing a Quit will work also, but you will get a nasty message
due to the fact that the flight command servers have already
terminated.<P>

<H3><A NAME="P2.2">2.2</A>: IOMODE</H3>

The IOMODE command affects how the command line behaves. The 
default bahaviour is to automatically complete a word whenever 
the input is sufficient to do so. Other options are to never 
complete words, or to complete words only when the user types a 
space character. The value of n is bit-mapped, so it is 
determined by adding up the values of the desired options.
The available options are:

<DL>
<DT>Backspace=1
<DD>indicates that typing a backspace should backup
to the last significant input character. An input character
is significant if it narrows the list of possible commands.
<DT>Space=2
<DD>Indicates that typing a space or newline should be treated as a
request to auto-advance.
<DT>Always=4
<DD>Words or letters are filled in whenever the following letters
are unambiguous.
<DT>Word=8
<DD>Disables advances within words unless the rest of the current
word is unambiguous (e.g. prevents advancing 'O' for On/Off)
<DT>Wordskip=16
<DD>Allows auto-advancement over entire words. If
not specified, auto-advance will always stop at the
beginning of a word.
</DL>

The default value for IOMODE is 7 (Backspace, Space, Always).<P>

<H2><A NAME="P3">3</A>: Data Analysis</H2>

After your data acquisition is completed, post-run analysis 
begins. To begin, the log files are saved as a "run". This
is handled directly or indirectly by the <A 
HREF="#P3.2">saverun</A> utility which creates an appropriately
named directory and moves the log files into it. Next, the data 
may need to be copied off of the flight computer onto the GSE for 
analysis and/or archiving. Finally, extraction programs are 
applied to the raw data to render the data in a form useful for 
subsequent analysis by the <A HREF="#P3.3">extract</A> utility.<P>

This entire process is automatated at a higher level by the
<A HREF="#P3.1">reduce</A> utility. When properly configured,
a simple "reduce" command will perform all these functions in
one step.<P>

<H3><A NAME="P3.1">3.1</A>: reduce</H3>

Reduce is the one-stop-shopping solution to post-run data 
analysis. It is configurable via the
<A HREF="../manuals/exconfig.html">Experiment.config</A> file.
It will invoke saverun if you haven't already, or you
may specify an existing data directory to re-run extractions
and analyses. For flight operations, reduce can also 
perform filesystem diagnostics prior to moving the data in order
to better ensure the data integrity.<P>

<H3><A NAME="P3.2">3.2</A>: saverun</H3>

Saverun is invoked by reduce to create a run directory. You may
find a need to run saverun independently, but then again, you
may not. Saverun's operation is also configured in
<A HREF="../manuals/exconfig.html">Experiment.config</A>.

<H3><A NAME="P3.3">3.3</A>: extract</H3>

Extract is used to replay the instrument's data stream. It takes 
as arguments the name of the data directory and the name of 
programs which will process the data stream. These programs are
commonly "extraction" programs which convert the data to useful
units and save it in a useful form, such as a SNAFU spreadsheet.
Like saverun, extract is run indirectly by reduce, but you may
find it useful to run extract directly under certain 
circumstances.<P>

<H3><A NAME="P3.4">3.4</A>: Realtime Analysis</H3>

Not all data analysis needs to be done after your run is complete.
It is possible to perform fairly complex calculations in real
time. One of the key goals in the design of the
<A HREF="../manuals/tmc.html">TMC</A> language was to make this
sort of analysis possible with a minimum of effort.<P>

In addition, I have developed a slightly higher-level processor
known as <A HREF="../manuals/cycle2.html">CYCLE</A> which is
particularly suited to averaging data over command cycles. Cycle
is capable of everything the SNAFU Solenoid Difference Calculation
is and quite a bit more.<P>

<H2><A NAME="P4">4</A>: Software Modifications</H2>

<P>Since this is a <STRONG>User's Guide</STRONG>, we won't go
into great detail regarding programming. See the
<A HREF="das_dev.html">ARP Data Acquisition Experiment
Developer's Guide</A> for more information.

<P>As a user, you will find most of the instrument programming
has been taken care of, but you may find a need to modify an
algorithm or a SOLDRV cycle definition or an extraction.

<H3><A NAME="P4.1">4.1</A>: Source Directory</H3>

<P>The first thing you need to know is that the source code for
you instrument is not kept in the home directory, but rather in a
dedicated source code directory. [Yes, you do see
<CODE>tmc</CODE> and <CODE>tma</CODE> files in the home directory
also, but these are copies of the real source, distributed here
for archival reasons. (Alright: they are copied into the data
directory by <A HREF="#P3.2"><CODE>saverun</CODE></A> so that
next month you will be able to figure out what you were doing.)]

<P>In any event, you'll need to know where the source code is
kept. It might be in a subdirectory of the home directory named
"<CODE>src</CODE>", or it might be in a subdirectory of that
directory, or it might be located on a different computer.

<H3><A NAME="P4.2">4.2</A>: make & make distribution</H3>

<P>After you've made your changes, there are two more steps
before they can be used. First, you must <STRONG>compile</STRONG>
your changes, or translate them into a format the computer can
understand. The single command that will compile all your source
code is "<CODE>make</CODE>". If <CODE>make</CODE> encounters any
errors along the way, you'll have to go back and fix the
appropriate source code. (see
<A HREF="das_dev.html#PA.0">Troubleshooting Compilations</A>).

<P>Once you've compiled all your source code, you need to
<STRONG>distribute</STRONG> the results to the home directories
of the GSE and flight computers. The command for this is:

<PRE>
        make distribution TGTNODE=//<i>n</i>
</PRE>

<P>where <i>n</i> is replaced with the node number of computer
to which you wish to distribute.

<H2><A NAME="P5">5</A>: Software Components</H2>

<P>The following provides a brief description of some of the
files to be found in the home directory.

<H3><A NAME="P5.1">5.1</A>: Experiment.config</H3>

<P>This file defines several key parameters used by many of the
programs which make up the data acquisition system. The most
important parameters are "Experiment" and "HomeDir" which
identify the instrument's name and home directory. All the
parameters are defined in the <A HREF="../manuals/exconfig.html">
Experiment.config Reference Manual</A>.

<H3><A NAME="P5.2">5.2</A>: tm.dac</H3>

<P>This file is generated during the compilation of the
instrument's collection program. It is a small binary file
containing a crude specification of the generated telemetry
frame. It doesn't contain any of the individual data definitions,
just enough information to allow some generic utilities to
process the files. The format of the file is specified in the
header file <CODE>/usr/local/include/dbr.h</CODE>.

<H3><A NAME="P5.3">5.3</A>: *.pcm</H3>

<P>This file provides a much more verbose description of the
generate telemetry frame, including the precise location of every
datum therein. Of particular interest is the summary information
at the top of the file which outlines the basic size and shape of
the frame. The "bits/sec" number can be used to precisely
calculate how much disk space the instrument will require for a
given flight.

<H3><A NAME="P5.4">5.4</A>: interact</H3>

<P><CODE>interact</CODE>, and <CODE>runfile.*</CODE> are the
names most often given to the shell scripts which start up the
data acquisition system on the flight computer.
<CODE>interact</CODE> specifically implies how the instrument
should run when started interactively via a <CODE>doit</CODE>
script.

<H3><A NAME="P5.5">5.5</A>: runfile.xxxx</H3>

<P><CODE>runfile.xxxx</CODE> is an instrument start-up script
that may be enabled for disabled based on the position of
configuration switches on the instrument. Since flight systems
must ordinarily start taking data on turn-on without operator
intervention, this provides a means of disabling automatic
start-up in the lab.

<H3><A NAME="P5.6">5.6</A>: runfile.dflt</H3>

<P><CODE>runfile.dflt</CODE> is a start-up script which is run if
no appropriate <CODE>runfile.xxxx</CODE> script is found. This
file cannot be disable by a switch setting (unless the switches
select another existing file).

<H3><A NAME="P5.7">5.7</A>: doit</H3>

<P><CODE>doit</CODE> is the generic name given to GSE start-up
scripts. Instruments often have more than one of these scripts,
allowing more than one view of the instrument(s). This file is
compiled from a source file of type <CODE>.doit</CODE>. See
the <A HREF="../manuals/mkdoit2.html">MkDoit2 Manual</A> for
details on the format of the source file.

<P>Assuming the flight system is powered up and standing by, the
data acquisition system can be started by entering the doit
command. Alternately, the doit command can be issued before the
instrument is powered on in order to redirect its default
behaviour. In this case, the command "<CODE>doit not</CODE>" is
useful to request that the flight system <em>not</em> start up.

<P>If the flight system is up and running, and you need to shut
it down but don't have a GSE screen up, you can send a low-level
shutdown command via the command "<CODE>doit stop</CODE>". This
is particularly useful if you've managed to get your GSE and
flight system software out of synch so the flight command server
rejects your keyboard client's "quit" command.

<H2><A NAME="P6">6</A>: System Maintainance</H2>

<P>Here are a number of utilities we've written over the years
to allow users to perform some tasks usually reserved for super
users.

<H3><A NAME="P6.1">6.1</A>: osupdate</H3>

<P>This utility allows a user to update the system software on
their node. From time to time, we write new programs, fix bugs in
old programs or add new features. We have found it unadvisable to
distribute these updates without users' knowledge, since any
changes may have unforseen consequences which may arise at very
inconvenient times. Instead, we allow the users to decide when
they are ready to deal with changes, and install them using this
command. Usually such updates are transparent to the user, but if
they've done the udpate themselves and a problem does arise, they
are more likely to associate the problem with the update, which
will enhance our ability to resolve it.

<P>Whenever an update is performed with osupdate, the results are
mailed to the system administrator and the node administrators.
This means that you and I both know that a change has occurred,
whether you initiated it or I did.

<H3><A NAME="P6.2">6.2</A>: fixdisk</H3>

<P><CODE>fixdisk</CODE> is a thin cover for the QNX
<CODE>chkfsys</CODE> utility. Ordinarily you need to be root to
run chkfsys. fixdisk will let you run it if you are a node
administrator.

<H3><A NAME="P6.3">6.3</A>: settime</H3>

<P>Like fixdisk, <CODE>settime</CODE> is a thin cover for the QNX
<CODE>date</CODE> and <CODE>rtc</CODE> utilities, allowing node
administrators to update their node's system and hardware clocks.
See "use settime" for more information.

<H3><A NAME="P6.4">6.4</A>: flttime</H3>

<P><CODE>flttime</CODE> is related to settime, and is used to
synchronize the clocks of a flight computer and a GSE computer by
setting the flight computer's clock to the current time on the
GSE computer. See "use flttime" for more information.

<H2><A NAME="P7">7</A>: Flight Operations</H2>

<P>What follows are few guidelines for users during field
deployments. This is partly my opinion and partly what I've
learned from watching our best scientists in the field.

<H3><A NAME="P7.1">7.1</A>: Know Your System</H3>

<P>Perhaps the most important thing to understand as a scientist on
a field mission is that you are ultimately responsible for the
successful operation of your instrument. Yes, you have software
support, but if the instrument fails, you are the one who has to
explain it to the other experimenters. Your best hope is to
cultivate a thorough understanding of your system. This will
serve you well when you need to make configuration choices at
0400.

<H3><A NAME="P7.2">7.2</A>: Question Updates</H3>

<P>As a rule, change is a dangerous thing during field
operations. If it ain't broke, don't fix it. Resolve stylistic
issues before reaching the field, or during test flights.

<P>Structure your code so routine algorithm adjustments are
localized. Use revision control to document all changes. Use rcsdiff
to double-check the changes you've made against the version from
the previous flight.

<P>If the change you wish to make is not routine, question
carefully whether it is worth attempting. Ask your software
support how big the change is, but reserve judgement for
yourself.

<P>Be particularly careful when attempting to identify system
failure modes and compensate for them. Make certain you are not
introducing failure modes rather than eliminating them. If
possible, make sure the action will only take effect when you are
otherwise guaranteed to get no useful data.

<H3><A NAME="P7.3">7.3</A>: Test Using Flight Configuration</H3>

<P>Be very careful to ascertain that the system will operate in a
flight configuration. Starting via "doit" is not good enough,
since flight mode usually uses a different start-up script.
Disconnect from the network and power up the system. Does it
start up alright? After the system is up and running, you can
reconnect to see how it's doing.

<H3><A NAME="P7.4">7.4</A>: Test New Algorithms</H3>

<P>Make sure any changes you've made will work by exercising them
in a flight configuration. If the changes are intended to
compensate for a possible failure mode, be sure to simulate that
failure mode to make sure the results are as desired.
