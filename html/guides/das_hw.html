<H2><A NAME="P1.0">1.0: Hardware</A></H2>

For each board type, I would like to provide the following information:
	
<PRE>
	What is the function of the board?
	What are the salient performance figures?
	What are the different configuration options?
	  What are the important addresses?
	  What are the jumper options?
	  Are mods required to the board? Where are they specified?
	What diagnostics are available?
</PRE>

<H3><A NAME="P1.1">1.1: System Controller</A></H3>

The System Controller, in its various revisions, provides
the interface between the ISA bus of an instrument's computer
and the "Subbus" for connection to the Interface Card Cage (ICC)
and other in-house electronics.<P>

Documentation currently available for the System Controllers
consists of schematics (offline) and the
<A HREF="../manuals/subbus.html">Subbus Cable Definition</A><P>

The diagnostic utilities which pertain to the System Controllers
are <A HREF="#P2.2">syscon</A>, <A HREF="#P2.3">scdebug</A>,
and <A HREF="#P2.4">bckpln</A>.

<H3><A NAME="P1.2">1.2: ICC Backplane</A></H3>
<H3><A NAME="P1.3">1.3: Timerbd</A></H3>
<H3><A NAME="P1.4">1.4: A/D</A></H3>
<H3><A NAME="P1.5">1.5: D/A</A></H3>
<H3><A NAME="P1.6">1.6: Digio</A></H3>
<H3><A NAME="P1.7">1.7: Counters</A></H3>
<H3><A NAME="P1.8">1.8: Indexer</A></H3>
<H3><A NAME="P1.9">1.9: Ozone Board</A></H3>

<H2><A NAME="P2.0">2.0: Diagnostics</A></H2>

For each diagnostic utility, I would like to answer the following 
questions:

<PRE>
	What hardware does it address?
	What kind of problems can it identify?
	Under what conditions can the utility be run?
	  While TM is running?
	  With the instrument connected?
	  With cards installed in the ICC?
	If a problem is identified, what then?
	  For example, if SYSCON fails, scdebug might well be the next step.
</PRE>

<H3><A NAME="P2.1">2.1: General Guidelines</A></H3>

By way of introduction, there are some common features of the diagnostic 
packages discussed here. With one or two exceptions, these diagnostics are 
designed to be run stand-alone. That is, they should not be run while data 
acquisition is underway. Some of the diagnostics require that any 
instrumentation be disconnected from the cards under test or that cards be 
removed from the ICC. Please make sure that you understand the rules for 
the diagnostic you plan to run before invoking it.<P>

Our user-level data acquisition operations allow you to issue a simple 
command to cause data acquisition to begin on a node which is (possibly)
different from your GSE. This is generally not the case with the 
diagnostics. While they can be run over the network, they must execute on 
the node connected to the hardware. There are several ways to accomplish 
this in QNX. If the flight node is 20, any of the following commands will 
cause <TT>card</TT> to be executed on node 20:<P>

<PRE>
	//20 card
	on -n 20 card
	onnode 20 card
</PRE>

You may also wish to start a shell on the flight node so all subsequent 
commands will be invoked on that node:<P>

<PRE>
	on -n 20 sh
</PRE>
I will briefly summarize each of the existing diagnostics with a more 
detailed description to follow.

<H3><A NAME="P2.2">2.2: SYSCON</A></H3>

<TT>syscon</TT>
tests each function of the System Controller board. As the first 
link in the path to the instrument, this is always a good place to start. 
This diagnostic doesn't help much if problems are reported, in which case 
you will probably need to advance to
<TT>scdebug</TT>.

<H3><A NAME="P2.3">2.3: SCDEBUG</A></H3>
<TT>scdebug</TT>
is very much an interactive diagnostic. It performs a number of tests on 
the System Controller and attempts to identify particular problem areas. 
When a problem is uncovered,
<TT>scdebug</TT>
loops, continuously performing an action appropriate to facilitate hardware 
diagnosis of the problem. For example, if data is not being read back 
correctly from one of the latches,
<TT>scdebug</TT>
will repeatedly write and read the problem data so the bit values can be 
traced throughout the board.<P>

<H3><A NAME="P2.4">2.4: BCKPLN</A></H3>
If
<TT>syscon</TT>
passes,
<TT>bckpln</TT>
is the next place to look.
<TT>bckpln</TT>
allows you to manipulate all of the computer-controlled signals on the 
subbus cable and the ICC backplane. It includes configuration options to 
allow it to be used with no more test equipment than a volt meter but
includes functionality to obtain more detailed data if a scope is 
available.<P>

<H3><A NAME="P2.5">2.5: CARD</A></H3>
<TT>card</TT>
is the one diagnostic that can safely be run during data acquisition. 
Except for the "subbus debug" mode, it is a totally passive diagnostic, 
simply reading data values from A/D boards. At a quick glance,
<TT>card</TT>
can tell you whether your A/D boards are behaving properly. It is also 
useful for verifying raw data values when reading converted values off of a 
telemetry screen.<P>

<H3><A NAME="P2.6">2.6: DIGITAL2</A></H3>
<TT>digital2</TT> is similar to <TT>bckpln</TT> and <TT>scdebug</TT>
in that it provides low-level control over all the digital command lines on 
all of the digital command boards. It should definitely be run with the 
instrument disconnected, for obvious reasons. With a digio board in the 
ICC, it is an excellent end-to-end 
diagnostic since it can write to latches on both sides of the data bus and 
read back the values. If it passes its initialization successfully, you can 
be assured the datapath to the ICC is sound.<P>

<H3><A NAME="P2.7">2.7: TMRTEST</A></H3>
<TT>tmrtest</TT>
provides a crude test of the functionality of the timer board (formerly 
known as the "System Board"). This is a pass/fail test, and is of little 
use in diagnosing a malfunctioning board. It does work effectively to 
disable the use of timers whose interrupts are not working.<P>

<H3><A NAME="P2.8">2.8: DTOATEST</A></H3>
This diagnostic provides enough controls to fully exercise D/A converters. 
Tests for linearity, full scale calibration, slew rate and hysteresis are 
all possible.<P>

<H3><A NAME="P2.9">2.9: INDXDIAG</A></H3>
This is a low-level diagnostic for the indexer boards along the lines of 
<TT>scdebug.</TT>
For a higher-level workout, we have a complete data acquisition setup which 
provides all the high-level commands with a realtime display.<P>
