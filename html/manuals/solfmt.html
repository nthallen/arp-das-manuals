<H2><a id=Introduction>Introduction</A></H2>

Solenoid Cycles are specified in a text file.  The format of this file is
designed to be simple yet flexible, providing the experimenter with all the
standard capabilities for solenoid control in a self documenting style.  The
solenoid file allows the definition of any number of modes of operation at
possibly different time resolutions.

<H2><a id="Tutorial">Tutorial</A></H2>

To illustrate the use of the solenoid format, I will define a cycle to drive
two solenoids in a four second cycle with a resolution of 1/4 second. 
First, we must define the two solenoids.  I will call them A and B.
<PRE>
        solenoid A 22 23 14
        solenoid B 24 25 15
</PRE>
The first line defines A to be a solenoid and specifies that command 22
will open A, 23 will close it, and status bit 14 will report its state. 
Similarly, the second line associates B with commands 24 and 25 and
status bit 15.<P>

Next, we specify the time resolution we want:
<PRE>
        resolution = 1/4
</PRE>
Now we are ready to specify the solenoid cycles:
<PRE>
        mode 0 {
          A: OOOO:OO__:____:__OO
          B: ____:_OOO:____:____
        }
</PRE>
This command defines the actual solenoid positions for mode 0.  The character
`O' represents an open solenoid valve and the character `_'
represents a closed valve. Solenoid A starts out open and remains open
for one and a half seconds, then stays closed for two seconds, when it
reopens.  B starts closed and opens 1/4 of a second before A
closes, and then stays open for only 3/4 of a second.  The length of the
cycle is implicit in this definition.

The format of the mode command is fairly flexible.  If all the information
doesn't fit on one line, it may be continued on another line simply by
beginning the new line with the solenoid name and a colon.  This continuation
does not have to appear immediately after its predecessor, since the name
makes it clear to which sequence the data belongs.  Hence, we could add
another four seconds to this mode with the command:

<PRE>
        mode 0 {
          A: OOOO:OO__:____:__OO
          B: ____:_OOO:____:____

          A: OOOO:OO__:___O:_O_O
          B: ____:_OOO:OOO_:O_O_
        }
</PRE>

It is also possible to change the characters which designate open and closed
valves by using the commands:
<PRE>
        open = '&lt;open character&gt;'
        close = '&lt;close character&gt;'
</PRE>

The solenoids we have used so far are commanded by two strobed commands.
In practice, these don't have to be solenoids at all, but any device
which is commanded with two strobed commands. Although solenoids are
a very common application, soldrv has been used to command heaters
and other devices as well.

Sometimes, however, cycling of devices which aren't controlled
by strobed commands is desired. Soldrv has two additional features
to support more complicated devices: set points and proxies.

Analog set points are defined using the DtoA command. For example:
<PRE>
        DtoA C 0E10 { L:50 M:1000 H:4000 }
</PRE>
defines an analog control named `C' using the D/A channel at address
0E10 which has three values designated `L', `M' and `H'. When a particular
set point is specified, the corresponding value is written out to the
channel's address. These set points can be used in a mode just like `O' and `_'
for solenoids:
<PRE>
        mode 1 {
          C: LLLL:LLMM:MHHM:MMLL
          C: LLLL:LLMM:HMML:MLML
        }
</PRE>

Proxies provide the most general control capability by allowing soldrv
to communicate with other control programs. The syntax for proxy
definitions is similar to that for DtoA definitions:
<PRE>
        Proxy D { L:3 M:4 H:7 }
</PRE>
The numbers associated with each state are proxy ID numbers. These
must be unique for all proxy states in the file and must match the
proxy IDs used by the associated control programs. At runtime, the
associated control program contacts soldrv to register a proxy
using the ID number (e.g. "Here's a proxy for ID 3"). Until
the proxy is registered, cycling a proxy element will do nothing.
Once the proxy is registered, a change in state specified in the
mode definition (Changing from say `L' to `M') will cause soldrv
to trigger the proxy associated with the new state.<P>

Proxies are used on the ER-2 OH experiment to drive the laser on and
off line. The laser is actually controlled by the indexer control
program. That program must register the appropriate proxies with
soldrv before the laser can be cycled.<P>

There is one other significant character on a cycle definition line.
This is the "switch character" which is permanently defined as the
caret (^).  The switch character is used to identify good points
for mode changes.  By carefully placing switch characters within your
solenoid cycles, you can guarantee that each cycle will run to completion
before an alternate mode is selected.<P>

You may add any other characters as desired to make the
text more readable.  In the above examples, I used colons to designate whole
seconds. The main limitation on the mode specification is that the cycles
specified for each of the solenoids must be of the same 
length.<P>

Solenoids which are not being cycled may be set to defined positions by use
of the initialize command.  If at the beginning of Mode 0 above we typed:
<PRE>
        initialize A:O
</PRE>
solenoid A would be initialized to an open position whenever Mode 0 was
selected.<P>

There are an arbitrary number of possible modes.  Each mode consists of
initializations and/or cycle definitions.  An undefined mode performs neither
initializations nor cycles.  Conversely, a mode that does neither is
considered undefined.  A mode with no cycle defined performs any specified
initializations and then waits for another mode to be selected.  Hence,
initializations may be considered the "d.c. component" of a mode
definition.<P>

In addition to initializations and cycle definition lines, a mode may
contain the command:
<PRE>
        select &lt;MODE-NUMBER&gt;
</PRE>
where &lt;MODE-NUMBER&gt; is the number of the desired mode.  When the cycling program
reaches this command, it will select the new mode as if that mode had been
selected from the command line or a flight algorithm.  The select
command must be the last command in a mode.  A mode that ends with this
command does not actually cycle, but rather executes its instructions once
and then selects the new mode.

<DL>
<DT><CODE>solenoid &lt;solenoid name&gt; &lt;open&gt; &lt;close&gt;
 &lt;status&gt;</CODE>

<DD>This command identifies a solenoid by giving it a name and 
defining the discrete commands which will open and close it and 
the status bit which will report its current position.  &lt;
open&gt; and &lt;close&gt; are the respective discrete command 
numbers.  &lt;status&gt; is the status bit number, usually a 
non-negative integer less than 32.

<DT><CODE>DtoA &lt;DtoA name&gt; &lt;address&gt; { &lt;Set 
Points&gt; }</CODE>

<DD>DtoA defines a digital to analog converter for set point 
selection.  Like the solenoids, each D/A channel is given a name 
and the subbus address is specified.  Unlike the solenoids, the 
D/A channels may have more than two states.  Each entry within 
the curly braces defines a single set point by specifying a 
character and a value (C:&lt;value&gt;).  The value is an 
unsigned decimal integer within the range of the D/A converter.  
The set point characters defined with this statement are local to 
a particular D/A channel and may be reused in other D/A channels 
as desired.

<DT><CODE>Proxy &lt;Proxy name&gt; { &lt;Set Points&gt; }</CODE>

<DD>Proxy defines a device which is controlled through proxies. 
Each state of the device has a proxy ID associated with it. When 
a state is specified, the associated proxy is triggered. Proxy 
IDs must be less then 256. (see <A HREF="#Tutorial">Tutorial</A> 
for an example.)

<DT><CODE>open = '&lt;open character&gt;'</CODE>
<DT><CODE>close = '&lt;close character&gt;'</CODE>

<DD>These two commands define the characters which are used in all the solenoid
mode definitions to indicate opened and closed solenoids.  The default
character for open is `O' and for closed is `_'.

<DT><CODE>status_bytes { &lt;addresses&gt; }</CODE>

<DD>This command allows for the specification of the addresses of 
the status bytes. The addresses are hexadecimal integers.  The 
default addresses are 408, 40A, 411, and 413 which correspond to 
the status input ports on the digital input board used on the 
<STRONG>ER-2 ClO</STRONG> and <STRONG>ABLE-3A</STRONG> 
experiments.  These are not the addresses used on 
<STRONG>ABLE-3B</STRONG> which uses the new digio board.
<STRONG>Any functionality associated with this command is 
purely imaginary. The syntax is maintained for compatibility 
alone.</STRONG>

<DT><CODE>resolution =  &lt;number&gt;/&lt;number&gt;</CODE>

<DD>Resolution defines the time quantum for the following modes 
in fractions of a second.

<DT><CODE>mode &lt;number&gt; { &lt;mode defs&gt; }</CODE>
<DT><CODE>routine &lt;routine name&gt; { &lt;valving defs&gt; }</CODE>

<DD>Mode and routine define the actual solenoid cycles which will 
be executable. The numbers associated with a mode are the numbers 
which will actually be used to invoke a particular mode long 
after all the mnemonics have been stripped away.  Routines are a 
simple form of subroutine useful in mode definitions. Solfmt 
produces an in-line compilation of routines within modes and does 
not allow for any nesting of routines or recursion.

<DT><CODE>select &lt;mode number&gt;</CODE>

<DD>This command is used within a mode or routine to indicate 
that soldrv should switch immediately to the indicated mode.  
This is useful for calibration modes which do not need to cycle, 
but can automatically switch over to the operational mode upon 
completion.

<H2><a id=Syntax>Solenoid File Syntax</A></H2>

This section precisely defines the syntax of the solenoid 
file.<P>

The solenoid file consists of any number of commands:
<PRE>

    <a id="command">command</A>

</PRE>
<H2><a id=SFTFMT>.sft File Format</A></H2>

A .sft file is the output of the solfmt program.  It may be
thought of as a sequence of structures defined as follows:
<PRE>
        int version;
        char command_set;
        int n_solenoids;
        struct {
          int open_cmd;
          int close_cmd;
          int status_addr;
          int status_mask;
        } solenoids[n_solenoids];
        int n_set_points;
        struct {
          int address;
          int value;
        } set_points[n_set_points];
        int n_proxies;
        unsigned char proxy_ids[n_proxies];
        int n_modes;
        int mode_indices[n_modes];
        int n_bytes;
        char mode_codes[n_bytes];
</PRE>

<CODE>version</CODE> specifies the version of both the solfmt 
program and the solenoid driver program in BCD.  Version 2.0 is 
designated by the hex value 0200.  If the solenoid driver program 
reads in a .sft file and finds that the version number is 
different, an error should be reported. An exception might be 
that between version 2.0 and 3.0 the <CODE>n_proxies</CODE> was 
added. Soldrv V3.0 should probably recognize V2.0 programs, 
simply setting <CODE>n_proxies</CODE> to 0.<P>

<CODE>n_solenoids</CODE> is the total number of solenoids that 
have been defined.<P>

For each defined solenoid, the <CODE>open_cmd</CODE>, 
<CODE>close_cmd</CODE>, <CODE>status_addr</CODE>, and 
<CODE>status_mask</CODE> are recorded.  The <CODE>open_cmd</CODE> 
and <CODE>close_cmd</CODE> are the numbers for the discrete 
commands that open and close the solenoid.  The associated status 
bit may be found by anding the <CODE>status_mask</CODE> with the 
contents of subbus address <CODE>status_addr</CODE>.<P>

<CODE>n_set_points</CODE> is the total number of set points which 
have been defined.  Each set point is defined by a subbus address 
and the value that should be written out to that address.<P>

<CODE>n_proxies</CODE> is the total number of proxies defined. 
<CODE>proxy_ids</CODE> contain the IDs for the proxies.<P>

<CODE>n_modes</CODE> is the maximum mode number defined plus one. 
<CODE>mode_indices</CODE> is an array of pointers into the 
mode_codes array indicating where the program for that mode 
begins.<P>

<CODE>n_bytes</CODE> determines the length of the 
<CODE>mode_codes</CODE> array.  The <CODE>mode_codes</CODE> array 
itself is a simple compiled code for operating the solenoid 
cycles.  There are five command codes defined as follows:<P>

<CODE>SOL_STROBES</CODE> 0: The following byte is the number of a
discrete command to be executed.<P>

<CODE>SOL_WAIT</CODE> 1: Wait for a significant event triggered by the timer
(which has already been programmed.)<P>

<CODE>SOL_SET_TIME</CODE> 2: The next two bytes are a count to be 
written to the timer.  The timer should be programmed using mode 
three (square wave.)<P>

<CODE>SOL_GOTO</CODE> 3: The next two bytes are the index of the 
next instruction.<P>

<CODE>SOL_END_MODE</CODE> 4: No action should be taken until a 
new mode is selected.  Equivalent to a Halt instruction.<P>

<CODE>SOL_WAITS</CODE> 5: Wait for <I>n</I> significant events, 
where <I>n</I> is the value of the next byte.<P>

<CODE>SOL_SELECT</CODE> 6: Select mode number <I>n</I>, where 
<I>n</I> is the value of the next byte.<P>

<CODE>SOL_MSWOK</CODE> 7: Indicates that a mode switch is 
allowable. If a mode switch is pending, it will occur at this 
point.<P>

<CODE>SOL_DTOA</CODE> 8:  The following byte is a set point 
index. The corresponding value should be written out to the 
corresponding address.<P>

<CODE>SOL_PROXY</CODE> 9: The following byte is a proxy index. 
The index is <STRONG>not</STRONG> the proxy ID, but rather the 
index into the array defined in the .SFT file. If the appropriate 
proxy has been registered, it should be triggered.<P>

<CODE>SOL_MULT_STROBES</CODE> 10: The remainder of this record 
matches the format for the SCDC multi-strobe command, allowing 
simultaneous switching of solenoids.<P>

Throughout the .sft file, all integers are stored as two bytes with the
least significant byte stored first.<P>
