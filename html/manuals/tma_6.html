<h3><a name="P6.1">6.1</a>: Program</h3>

<p>A TMCALGO <a href="tma_app.html#program">program</a> may contain
<a href="#P6.2">State definitions</a>,
<a href="#P6.3">Partition</a> statements,
<a href="tma_app.html#QUOTED-C-CODE">quoted C code</a>,
so-called <a href="#P6.4">&quot;Untimed Commands&quot;</a>,
or <a href="tma_app.html#COMMENT">comments</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="P6.2">6.2</a>: State</h3>
<p>A State Definition takes the form</P>
<pre>
      STATE <a href="tma_app.html#NAME">&lt;NAME&gt;</a> [ <a href="#P6.6">file-spec</a> ] [ NoLog ] {
        <a href="#P6.4">untimed-commands</a> 
        <a href="#P6.5">timed-commands</a>
      }
</pre>

<p>The <a href="tma_app.html#NAME">&lt;NAME&gt;</a> must be unique.</p>

<p>The optional <a href="#P6.6">file-spec</a> indicates that if
possible, the commands for this state should be read for the
specified file, which can be modified in realtime.</p>

<p>The optional keyword &quot;NoLog&quot; suppresses the log messages
printed whenever the state is entered. This is useful for tight
loops where logging would obscure useful information. [For the
exceedingly curious: logging is suppressed by increasing the
debug-level of the log message. Hence even NoLog state
transitions can be logged by adding '-ll' to the command line
options of the algorithm.]</p>

<h3><a name="P6.3">6.3</a>: Partition</h3>

<p>A TMCALGO program may be broken up into two or more &quot;partitions&quot;
by the use of the Partition statement. Each partition should include
one or more <a href="#P6.2">States</a>. Each new partition
defines an independent state machine which operates in parallel
with all the other partitions in the algorithm. Exactly one state
from each partition is valid at any time.</p>

<h3><a name="P6.4">6.4</a>: Untimed Commands</h3>

<p><a href="tma_app.html#untimed-command">Untimed Commands</a> are probably
misnamed; They are untimed only in the sense that they do not
have an explicit TMCALGO time specification before them, but
that alone is not enough to place a command in this category.
This category is limited to two varieties of TMC commands which,
by the nature of TMC, will have their &quot;timing&quot; determined by data
flow considerations.</p>

<p>The two TMC varieties are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="tma_app.html#TMC-STATEMENT">&lt;TMC-STATEMENT&gt;</a></li>
<li>DEPENDING ON <a href="tma_app.html#PARENSTAT">&lt;PARENSTAT&gt;</a> <a href="tma_app.html#TMC-STATEMENT">&lt;TMC-STATEMENT&gt;</a></li>
</ul>

<p>When appearing at the top of a <a href="#P6.2">state</a>
definition, untimed commands will be executed at their
TMC-determined rate whenever the state is valid, not just at the
beginning. This is often used to implement state-specific
watchdog functions:</p>

<pre>
        State Laser_On {
          { if (Laser_Temp &gt; 60) Validate Laser_Off; }
          ...
        }
</pre>

<p>When appearing at the end of a state, these commands
will be executed at their TMC-determined rate when the end of the
state is reached and until another state in the partition is
validated. This is often used to implement indefinite holds until
some condition is met before advancing to the next state:</p>

<pre>
        State Initialize {
          ...
          depending on (OFF_THE_GROUND) { Validate Flight; }
        }
</pre>

<p>When appearing in between <a href="#P6.5">timed commands</a>,
these commands are executed <STRONG>at most one time</STRONG>.</p>

<p>[ Since TMCALGO is not aware of the time dependencies of TMC,
it cannot determine whether you have allowed enough time for the
command to be executed. If the time you have allowed is less than
the TMC-determined period for the command, it is possible that
the command will not be executed at all. Be sure to leave enough
time! ]</p>

<p>This approach can be used to spot-check status:</P>

<pre>
        State Initialize {
          ...
          +3 &gt; Lamp On
          +4 { if (!Lamp_Is_On)
                 msg( 1, &quot;Lamp did not turn on!&quot; );
             }
          +1 &gt; ...
          ...
        }
</pre>

<p>In this example, I have allowed 1 second to evaluate the check
of Lamp_Is_On. Since that is the only variable referenced, it's
TMC rate determines the rate of the statement, so if it's period
is greater than 1 second (or rate less than 1 Hz), the warning
could be missed.</p>

<h3><a name="P6.5">6.5</a>: Timed Commands</h3>

<p>Timed commands include all the types of commands which can
appear within a <a href="#P6.2">state</a> definition, including
<a href="#P6.4">untimed commands</a>. These commands may be
proceeded by an optional <a href="tma_app.html#timed-commands">time</a>
specification.</p>

<p>Times may be listed in seconds, minutes and seconds, or hours,
minutes and seconds. The seconds and minutes need not be limited
to values less than 60. Times listed with a '+' indicate the time
delay between commands. Times listed without a '+' indicate that
the following command should be executed at the specified time
since the beginning of the state.</p>

<p>The possible commands are:</P>

<ul>
<li>'&gt;' ['_'] <a href="#P6.5.1">&lt;TEXT-COMMAND&gt;</a></li>
<li><a href="#P6.5.2">&lt;QUOTED-STRING&gt;</a> ';'</li>
<li><a href="#P6.5.3">VALIDATE &lt;NAME&gt;</a> ';'</li>
<li><a href="#P6.5.4">HOLD UNTIL [ VALID ] &lt;PARENSTAT&gt; timeout</a></li>
<li><a href="#P6.5.5">HOLD [ AND VALIDATE &lt;NAME&gt; ]
timeout</a></li>
<li><a href="#P6.5.6">RESUME &lt;NAME&gt; ';'</a></li>
<li><a href="#P6.4">untimed-command</a></li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="P6.5.1">6.5.1</a>: <a href="tma_app.html#TEXT-COMMAND">&lt;TEXT-COMMAND&gt;</a></h3>

<p>A &lt;TEXT-COMMAND&gt; is an experiment command in the same
syntax as is used from the interactive command program. The
command text is preceeded by a right angle bracket ( '&gt;' ).
In addition, an optional underscore character immediately
preceeding the text (with no intervening whitespace) will
suppress logging of this command. Together with the 'NoLog'
keyword, this feature is useful to quiet logging of very
repetetive operations.</p>

<p>This syntax does not allow for any variable substitution.
For that purpose, see the library routines <a
href="libref/ci_sendcmd.html">ci_sendcmd()</a> and <a
href="libref/ci_sendfcmd.html">ci_sendfcmd()</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="P6.5.2">6.5.2</a>: <a href="tma_app.html#QUOTED-STRING">&lt;QUOTED-STRING&gt;</a> ';'</h3>

<p>Quoted strings in a command position are used to help document
what the algorithm is doing when it might otherwise be unclear.
During operation, algorithms usually display the next experiment
command that is scheduled to be executed. If the next command is
not an experiment command, say a TMC command or HOLD UNTIL, the
default is to display nothing. If a quoted string is added to the
algorithm, the text can be displayed, perhaps prompting the user
to take some action:</P>

<pre>
        &quot;Waiting for SW Status 7&quot;;
        Hold until (SWStat == 7);
</pre>

<h3><a name="P6.5.3">6.5.3</a>: Validate <a href="tma_app.html#NAME">&lt;NAME&gt;</a> ';'</h3>

<p>Validate is used to activate an algorithm state. If the named
state is in the same partition as the current state, processing
in the current state terminates and subsequent commands are taken
from the newly validated state. The named state may also be in
another partition, in which case processing in the current state
continues as before.</p>

<p>The validate command performs the same function as the TMC
command of the same name. From an algorithm point of view</P>
<pre>
        Validate Foo;
</pre>
<p>Is equivalent to:</P>
<pre>
        { Validate Foo; }
</pre>
<p>but the former is slightly more efficient.</p>

<h3><a name="P6.5.4">6.5.4</a>: HOLD UNTIL</h3>

<p>HOLD UNTIL provides a shorthand syntax for introducing a
variable delay into a state. With this syntax, a separate state
must be introduced, which often makes the flow of the algorithm
more difficult to follow. The syntax is:</p>

<pre>
        HOLD UNTIL [ VALID ] <a href="tma_app.html#PARENSTAT">&lt;PARENSTAT&gt;</a> <a href="tma_app.html#timeout">timeout</a>
</pre>

<p>A simple example might be:</P>

<pre>
        Hold until (SWStat == 5);
</pre>

<p>This will suspend execution of timed commands in the current
state until the specified condition is met.
<a href="#P6.4">Untimed commands</a> at the top of the state will
continue to be executed. You may also wait for a state or states
to be validated:</P>

<pre>
        Hold until valid (OFF_THE_GROUND, LASER_ON);
</pre>

<p>This will wait until both states OFF_THE_GROUND and LASER_ON
are valid at the same time.</p>

<p>In both these cases, the degenerate timeout clause ';' is used
which indicates that the algorithm should wait forever for the
condition to be met. The options for timeout include:</P>

<pre>
        ';'
        OR <a href="tma_app.html#time">time</a> ';'
        OR <a href="tma_app.html#time">time</a> ELSE <a href="#P6.5">timed-command</a>
</pre>

<p>If the time specified elapses and the condition is not met,
timed command execution in the state is resumed and the ELSE
clause, if present, is executed:</P>

<pre>
        &gt; Lamp On
        Hold until ( convert( LM_RF ) &gt; 3.2 ) or 45
        else { msg( 1, &quot;Lamp Failed to light&quot; ); }
</pre>

<h3><a name="P6.5.5">6.5.5</a>: HOLD [ AND VALIDATE ]</h3>

<p>HOLD [ AND VALIDATE ] provides a generic hold capability
similar to <a href="P6.5.4">HOLD UNTIL</a> without any
explicit reference to TMC code that would require compilation.
This makes it possible to use this syntax in
<a href="P6.6">Runtime Command Files</a>.</p>

<p>The simplest form of this statement is:</p>

<pre>
        HOLD;
</pre>

<p>This causes the current state and partition to hold
indefinitely until a matching <a href="P6.5.6">RESUME</a>
statement is executed from another partition. In practice,
this means that each partition using this form of HOLD
needs a shadow partition to provide waiting states which
can issue the appropriate RESUME statements.</p>

<img src="tma_hs4.gif" width=282 height=386 align="left" alt="Example Algorithm with Two Partitions" hspace=20 border=0>

<p>The drawing at left is a graphical representation of the
partitions and states in a simple algorithm. Partition 0 contains
the main processing states while Partition 1 provides
&quot;Watch&quot; functions. The &quot;SlurpIt&quot; state
is a dynamically modifiable state, and is expected to include
<code><b>HOLD</b></code> statements. The &quot;Watch_Flat&quot;
state is statically programmed to wait for a specific condition
and then issue the command <code><b>Resume SlurpIt;</b></code>.</p>

<p>In order for this arrangement to work, SlurpIt will need to
<code><b>Validate Watch_Flat</b></code> before issuing the
<code><b>Hold</b></code>. This gives rise to a potential race
condition; if Watch_Flat issues its <code><b>Resume</b></code>
before SlurpIt issues its <code><b>Hold</b></code>, SlurpIt will
be left waiting indefinitely. This is where the form
<code><b>Hold and Validate</b></code> becomes useful. If the
command is written:</p>

<pre>
        <code><b>Hold and Validate Watch_Flat;</b></code>
</pre>

<p>the calling state will be marked as holding before
Watch_Flat is validated, effectively eliminating any race
condition.</p>

<p>As with the other <code><b>Hold</b></code> syntaxes, a
<code><b>Hold [ and Validate ]</b></code> statement may include a
<a href="tma_app.html#timeout">timeout</a> specification. Of course it is up
to the programmer to determine whether the timeout is more
appropriate in the holding state or the watching state.</p>

<br clear="left">

<h3><a name="P6.5.6">6.5.6</a>: RESUME &lt;NAME&gt; ';'</h3>

<p>The <code><b>Resume</b></code> statement is used in
conjunction with any of the <code><b>Hold</b></code>
statements. <code><b>Resume</b></code>'s single argument
is the name of the state that should be resumed. If the
designated state is currently holding, the hold condition
will be marked as succeeding, with processing continuing
at the following statement. If the state is not holding,
a diagnostic message is logged, but no other action is
taken.</p>

<h3><a name="P6.6">6.6</a>: Runtime Command Files</h3>

<p>The optional <a href="tma_app.html#file-spec">file-spec</a> in a State
definition specifies the name of a file from which commands will
be read. The quoted filename may be followed by a parenthesized
list of states you wish to make available for runtime validation
from the specified file. By default, all the states defined in
TMCALGO are available, so this feature is rarely needed.</p>

<p>The commands listed within the state are default commands
which are executed only if the specified file is not found or
contains a syntax error. An exception to this is that <a
href="#P6.4">untimed commands</a> appearing at the top of the
state definition will be executed. This means that you may be
able to provide a standard, compiled exit condition for the state
without requiring a separate watchdog partition.</p>

<p>The syntax of the runtime command files is a subset of
the TMCAlgo syntax. The commands in the file are the contents
of a single state, so none of the syntaxes involved with defining
states or partitions are supported. Basically, the syntax is
limited to <a href="#P6.5">timed commands</a> except that
&quot;Hold Until&quot; and <a href="#P6.4">untimed commands</a>
are not allowed. That leaves:</p>

<ul>
<li>'&gt;' ['_'] <a href="#P6.5.1">&lt;TEXT-COMMAND&gt;</a></li>
<li><a href="#P6.5.2">&lt;QUOTED-STRING&gt;</a> ';'</li>
<li><a href="#P6.5.3">VALIDATE &lt;NAME&gt;</a> ';'</li>
<li><a href="#P6.5.5">HOLD [ AND VALIDATE &lt;NAME&gt; ]
timeout</a></li>
<li><a href="#P6.5.6">RESUME &lt;NAME&gt; ';'</a></li>
<li><a href="tma_app.html#COMMENT">Comments</a></li>
</ul>

<p>You can validate any state in the algorithm, including
states in other partitions. If you want to validate a state
defined in another .tmc file, you will have to include the state
name in the list of allowed states following the file-spec in the
state definition.</p>

<p>When the state is first validated, the program attempts to
open and parse the specified file. If the file does not exist or
there is a syntax error, any errors are reported to the log and
the default commands are used. Otherwise the default commands are
ignored and the commands in the file are executed. Whenever the
state is re-validated, the status of the file is checked and if
the file is unchanged, it does not need to be re-read. If the
file has changed or has been removed, it is re-evaluated.</p>
