<p>Over the years, a few time-tested strategies for organizing
instrument algorithms have emerged. These are not the only
approaches that will work, of course, but they can give you
a good start.</p>

<p>To begin with, it is worth pointing out that TMCALGO
is a programming language, and many design principles that
apply to other languages apply to it as well:</p>

<ul>
<li>Keep your organization simple</li>
<li>Separate control of unrelated subsystems into separate
	partitions.</li>
<li>Avoid indiscriminate interference in other partitions'
	operations.</li>
<li>Clearly identify and document how one partition can
	affect another.</li>
</ul>

<p>One of the best resources for strategies is the
<a href="http://www.arp.harvard.edu/eng/systems/toc.html">source code
of existing instruments</a>. None of these represent a perfect
solution, and some older code may employ conventions we have since
moved away from, but they are a good place to start.</p>

<p>And of course one additional resource worth mentioning is
the author, who is more than happy to talk about your algorithms
until you can't stand it anymore.</p>

<h3><a name="P4.1">4.1</a>: First Partition</h3>

<img src="tma_hs5.gif" width=338 height=66 hspace=10 border=0
 alt="State Diagram" align="right">

<p>We have traditionally used the first partition of an
algorithm to outline the full course of data taking
for a run from initialization through shutdown. A minimal
implementation of this would have three states,
<b>Initialize</b>, <b>Record</b>, and <b>Shutdown</b>.
Record might well loop through some standard procedures until
conditions for advancing to Shutdown are recognized.</p>

<br clear="right">

 alt="State Diagram" align="right">

<p>The record state can also be broken up into two or more states to perform
particular types of operations. Doing so can allow certain procedures to
be executed only under particular circumstances.</p>

<br clear="right">

<img src="tma_hs7.gif" width=471 height=194 hspace=10 border=0
 alt="State Diagram" align="right" vspace=8>
<p>In this example, Record3 is only executed at high altitude:</p>
<br clear="right">

<p>Most instruments of any complexity require some additional elaboration.
For flight instruments, the major transitions may be keyed off of
<a href="#P4.2">changes in altitude</a> and may require additional states
to allow for the possibility of aborted landings or other false triggers.
Lab instruments may run unattended from start to finish, or they may
choose to use the <a href="#P4.3">software status</a> techniques to
provide keyboard control of the algorithm.</p>

<h3><a name="P4.2">4.2</a>: Keying off of Altitude</h3>

<p>When the Anderson Group first ventured from balloons onto
an airplane and lost ability to manually control the instrument
during flight, we had to rely on the pilot to signal the instrument
through a cockpit switch, indicating when the plane was taking off
or preparing to land. We soon discovered that the pilots hate to
have that level of responsibility for instrument operation. They
are extremely busy during takeoff and landing and would much
prefer to be flying the plane than punching buttons for instruments.
Needless to say, this was one of the first motivations for giving
algorithms a flexible way to access to the instrument data and take
actions accordingly.</p>

<p>Since planes go up at the beginning of a flight and come down
at the end, using altitude, or pressure, as an indication of where
we are in a flight works pretty well. I have included an
<a href="tma_alt.html">example</a> of code we have used on the
Chlorine Nitrate instrument (which is also nearly identical to
the corresponding code on half a dozen other instruments.)</p>

<p>There are two goals inherent in this design:</p>
<ol><li>Clearly
and globally define three altitude regions, ON_GROUND, BELOW_CLOUDS,
and ABOVE_CLOUDS that other partitions (notably <a href="#P4.1">partition
1</a>) can use to make decisions.</li>
<li>Provide a method for
emulating altitude changes in order to test other parts of the
algorithm while on the ground.</li></ol>

<p>The reason for having three altitude regions rather than two is
to allow instruments to start warming up as early as possible without
necessarily exposing the flows to dangerous water or ice particles
in the clouds. Instruments generally start their initializations when
they detect that the plane has left the ground, but don't advance to
full data-taking until the plane is safely &quot;above the clouds&quot;.
On the downward leg, tripping into BELOW_CLOUDS indicates impending
landing, allowing the instrument time for an orderly shutdown. The
algorithm does not advance to a full shutdown and quit until it detects
that the plane has gotten as low as ON_GROUND, allowing for a return
to data-taking if the plane climbs again.</p>

<p>The altitude emulation is accomplished via the use of
<a href="#P4.3">software status data</a> which can be set from the keyboard
interface. By issuing a keyboard command, this partition will advance to the
next altitude state. Other partitions which key off of these altitude states
(rather than looking directly at the pressure) will make decisions as if the
plane were in the air.</p>

<p>It is worth noting that while this approach is useful for testing <i>other</i>
partitions, it is in no way adequate for testing this partition. At least once
before flying a new instrument, this portion of the algorithm should be tested
by pumping on the pressure sensor to make sure that it properly detects changes
in pressure and that the algorithm does in fact perform the appropriate
transitions.</p>

<h3><a name="P4.3">4.3</a>: Using Software Status</h3>

<p>Software status is telemetry data that does not represent physical
properties that have been read via sensors but rather quantities that
have been set manually via software. This is useful for manually
adjusting setpoints for systems which are controlled by an algorithm,
for identifying regions of interest to data analysis software, and
for providing a means of communication between the operator and the
algorithm.</p>

<p>The subject of how to get software data into the telemetry stream
is outside the scope of this document. Many examples exist in the
<a href="http://www.arp.harvard.edu/eng/systems/toc.html">instrument
source code</a>, and a definitive example should be included in one
of the <a href="../guides/">guides</a>.</p>

<p>The remainder of this section is concerned with using a purely
arbitrary software status word which can be set to discrete values
from the keyboard. A command such as &quot;Set Software Status 7&quot;
can be used to assign a value to the variable, or more mnemonic commands
can be provided which are associated with specific values.</p>

<p>We have tried tying individual bits of a software status word to
particular functions, but have found this ultimately inadequate since
the number of bits available is relatively small compared with the number
of discrete values vailable. We have found it more effective to use
specific values of a software status variable to signal state transitions
which are recorded in the algorithm. For example, the value '7' might
signal the algorithm to enable a particular option, and the value '8' could
disable the option. The algorithm uses a local (non-TM) variable to hold
that option's state, and once the transition has been recognized, the
software status word need no longer be concerned with it.</p>

<p>In this approach, a software status value of zero represents &quot;no
operation&quot;, and every recognized operation is responsible for resetting
the software status once the specified operation has been recorded. I
have provided a minimal <a href="tma_swstat.html">example</a>, taken from
the Total Water and Ozone instrument. Using this as a starting point,
you can add all sorts of interactive controls to your experiment. You
will need to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Add a new case for each value you wish to recognize, including
the code necessary to record the command.</li>
<li>Make sure to terminate each case with a 'break' command unless
you intentionally want the procedure to fall through to the next case.</li>
<li>If a particular case is going to be handled in another part of the
algorithm, it is a good practice to list that case without any code
above the 'case 0:' line. This helps to document the fact that that
particular value is being used somewhere.</li>
</ul>
