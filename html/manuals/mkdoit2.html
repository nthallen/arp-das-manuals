<h2><a id="P1.0">1.0</a>: Compiler Invocation</h2>

Mkdoit2 is invoked with the following command format:<P>

<pre>
      mkdoit2 [ -o &lt;outputfile&gt; ] [ &lt;inputfile&gt; ... ]
</pre>

Users of the ARP Data Acquisition System will almost never need
to invoke the compiler directly; the invocation is handled by
<a href="appgen.html">appgen</a> and make.

<h2><a id="P2.0">2.0</a>: Introduction</h2>
<h3><a id="P2.1">2.1</a>: doit scripts</h3>

MkDoit2 is a language to generate "doit" scripts for use with ARP
Data Acquisition. It supports options for many features which
are handy to have in a doit script.<P>

For compatibility with <a href="appgen.html">APPGEN</a>, the
input filename should end in ".doit". The doit script can be generated
as part of the general make process by adding a line to the .spec
file such as:
<pre>
        abcdoit : abc.doit
</pre>

The resulting script is designed to work with most if not all
standard experimental configurations as specified in the
<a href="exconfig.html">Experiment.config</a> file. Invoking
the script should start up the instrument or immediately
attach to the instrument if it is already running. Multiple
simultaneous invocations are safely arbitrated to avoid conflicts
and deadlocks.<P>

In addition, the script can take one of two optional arguments,
"not" and "stop".
"doit not" is used to prevent an instrument from starting up if
it would do so automatically, such as in a flight configuration.
(Up until now, users would need to explicitly issue the command
"pick_file /dev/null", making sure that the environment variable
"Experiment" was properly defined first. With the advent of the
Experiment.config file, it is no longer necessary or desirable
to have Experiment predefined, since it can be looked up in the
file, but pick_file (and most of the other binary utilities)
require this definition. By nesting this command within the doit
script which reads Experiment.config, this process is simplified.)<P>

"doit not" can also be used to "clean up" in the event that a
disorderly shutdown has left some processes still running.<P>

"doit stop" will shut down an instrument that is already running
without requiring the full GSE program to be run. This is
accomplished by running the command "startdbr quit" on the flight
node with the appropriate Experiment definition from the
configuration file.<P>

<h3><a id="P2.2">2.2</a>: .doit files</h3>

A basic .doit input specification will define a display program and
a keyboard client program. For example:
<pre>
        display abcdisp abc
        client abcclt
</pre>

specifies that the display program "abcdisp" should be run and
that it requires one screen which should be initialized with the
scrdes file "abc.fld". The script will also invoke the keyboard
client program "abcclt".<P>

To add an algorithm, we could simply add the line:
<pre>
        algorithm abcalgo
</pre>

<p>Telemetry applications are classified into one or more of the
categories display, extraction, or algorithm. For the purposes of
mkdoit2, a display program is any TM client generated from a .fld
file or a .tbl file. An algorithm is any TM client which accesses
the command server using the "cic" functions, specifically
cic_options() as referenced from
/usr/local/include/oui/client.oui, which is true of any program
generated from .tma source files. Extraction is used for any TM
client that is not a display or algorithm, or for a display
program for which additional command-line options are desired.
</p>

<p>If it is necessary to list an application more than once, the
"display" entry must come first. For example, a display program
which also sends commands to the command server is actually both
a display and an algorithm. In this case, it should be listed
first as a display and next as an algorithm. It will appear in
the output file with the display programs, but it will have been
endowed with the command-line options required by command
clients. You might also need to list a program as both display
and extraction in order to specify a command-line option:</p>

<pre>
        display abcdisp abc
        extraction abcdisp -h ABCD
</pre>

<p>In any case, the listing for "display" must come first. Note
that the screen names listed must match those listed in the .spec
file in name, number and order or strange problems will
result.</p>

<p>There are numerous other options available listed in the
<a href="#P3.0">Input Syntax</a> below, and more will
inevitably be added as time goes by, so stay tuned!</p>

<h3><a id="P2.2.1">2.2.1</a>: Playback</h3>

<p>The playback option can be used to create a doit script which
will run on previously logged data. The resulting script takes a
run directory as an argument and invokes the rdr to playback the
data. It is possible to run displays, algorithms and graphics in
this mode, very much the same way as in real time, except that in
playback you have the option of running everything fast forward
or in slow motion in addition to real time.</p>

<p>In order to create a playback script from a realtime script,
replace the client specification with the keyword "playback" and
make sure any algorithms listed have the -p option (for
Playback). You may also optionally specify the autostart keyword
in order to have the data playback begin immediately without
requiring a manually-entered "Telemetry Start" command.</p>

<h3><a id="P2.2.2">2.2.2</a>: Inetin</h3>

<p>Inetin is used to specify that the script should run the Inetin
program to connect to a data stream on a remote system. As with
Playback, this option replaces the client keyword, invoking PBclt
instead. This configuration will also accept the autostart
keyword. The resulting script requires that the variable
RemoteHost be defined in Experiment.config.</p>

<h3><a id="P2.2.3">2.2.3</a>: Serin [options] &lt;device&gt;</h3>

<p>Serin is used to specify that the script should run the serin
program to connect to a data stream coming in on a serial port. As with
Playback, this option replaces the client keyword, invoking PBclt
instead. This configuration will also accept the autostart
keyword.</p>

<h2><a id="P2.3">2.3</a>: .fld Fields</h2>

<p>In addition to reading the .doit input file, mkdoit2 reads the .fld
files which are specified in each "display" statement. The following
field contents are recognized:</p>

<dl>
<dt>%STATUS:&lt;app&gt;</dt>
<dd>Defines the location of a status line for the specified
application.</dd>
<dt>%STATUS</dt>
<dd>Defines the location of a general status line for all applications 
which do not have their own status field.</dd>
<dt>%CLIENT</dt>
<dd>Indicates that a keyboard client should run on this screen. If
no such field is defined, the keyboard client will run on all display
screens. This is consistent with prior practice. Keyboard clients always 
appear on the last two rows of a console, so the only information extracted 
from this field is which screen it is on: row, column and width are 
ignored.</dd>
<dt>%TMA:&lt;app&gt;[:#]</dt>
<dd>Defines a status field for the specified TMCALGO. The partition number 
may optionally be specified, with the first partition in the algorithm 
being numbered 1. If no partition number is specified, the field refers to 
partition 1. All TMCALGO status fields require two rows and are 80 
characters wide, so the only information extracted from this field
is the row: column and width are ignored and assumed to be 0 and 80
respectively.</dd>
</dl>

<h2><a id="P3.0">3.0</a>: Input Syntax</h2>
<dl>
<dt>display &lt;program&gt; &lt;screen file&gt; [ &lt;screen file&gt; ... ]</dt>
<dd>Specifies a display program to run and the names of the .fld
files which define it. The list of .fld files must match those
listed in the .spec file in name, number and order or strange
problems will result.</dd>

<dt>client &lt;program&gt;</dt>
<dd>Specifies a keyboard client to run</dd>

<dt>monoconfig &lt;filename&gt;</dt>
<dt>colorconfig &lt;filename&gt;</dt>
<dd>Specifies explicit screen configuration files to use for monochrome
and/or color displays.</dd>

<dt>memo [ &lt;log file name&gt; ]</dt>
<dd>Specifies that "less +F &lt;log file&gt;" should run on a spare console
to provide a scrolling status window.</dd>

<dt>algorithm &lt;program&gt; [ options ]</dt>
<dd>Specifies an algorithm to run.</dd>

<dt>extraction &lt;program&gt; [ options ]</dt>
<dd>Specifies an extraction to run in realtime, for example an 
rtg extraction. Algorithms are different from Extractions in
that they send commands to the command server.</dd>

<dd>If either an algorithm or an extraction has a <b>-v</b>
option specified, the standard msg option ( -c$FlightNode )
is suppressed. This prevents status messages from being
sent to memo. Status messages to memo are also suppressed
for algorithms in playback mode (<b>-p</b>) accessing a
local instrument to prevent duplicate messages in the log.</dd>

<dt>batchfile &lt;batch file name&gt;</dt>
<dd>Specifies which script should be run on the flight node. The default
is "interact", but this option could be used to specify that the
flight "runfile.dflt" be used instead.</dd>

<dt>rtg &lt;config file&gt;</dt>
<dd>Requests that rtg be started if it isn't already running, and
defines the name of the rtg configuration file to use. The file
name should be absolute, since rtg will otherwise look in a
standard configuration directory.</dd>

<dt>playback</dt>
<dd>Specifies that the script is intended for playback. Playback
implies the use of the rdr, the PBreg speed regulation utility
and the PBclt keyboard client. No other client should be
specified. Any algorithms must have -p specified, for obvious
reasons.</dd>

<dt>inetin</dt>
<dd>Specifies that the script is intended for connection to a
remote data stream via the Inetin program. Like playback, inetin
implies the use of the PBreg speed regulation utility
and the PBclt keyboard client. No other client should be
specified. Algorithms should also have -p specified, since the
command server will not be reachable. (It is a fairly simple
matter to extend command capability to remote systems via
Inetsrvr and Inetcmd programs, but in most cases this is rather
undesirable.)</dd>

<dt>autostart</dt>
<dd>Used with playback and inetin, specifies that data should
begin playing as soon as all the TM clients have registered.</dd>

</dl>

<h2><a id="PA.0">A.0</a>: Invoking Scripts under QNX Windows</h2>

<p>The doit scripts generated by mkdoit2 have been carefully
designed to operate properly either on standard QNX consoles or
in QNX Windows wterm windows. Even invocations of rtg are safe,
as the doit script checks to see if windows is running and only
launches rtg if it is. Scripts can be invoked via the command
line in a wterm shell exactly as they are invoked on a QNX
console, but they can also be added to your personal windows
configuration to be selectable from the "Programs" menu without
first bringing up a shell.</p>

<p>In order to add a doit script to your menu, select "Properties..." from
the Workspace menu. This brings up the list of menu items for editting.
In the upper right corner, select "Personal" to bring up your private
selections.</p>

<p>Suppose we wanted to add an entry to run the NO2 instrument using the
script windoit with the menu entry, "Run NO2". Select the "Name:" field
and enter "Run NO2". Then select the "Invocation String:" field and
enter //9/home/no2/windoit.</p>
