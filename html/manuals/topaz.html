<H1>Topaz Laser QNX4 Driver Specification</H1>
The Topaz Laser Driver is intended to provide command control and 
telemetry interfaces to the Spectra Physics Topaz Series Laser 
System via an RS232 connection. It will interface to standard ARP 
data acquisition modules including Memo, CmdCtrl, Command 
Servers and TMC Data Collection.<P>

When first invoked, the driver will register with Memo and with 
CmdCtrl, if present, requesting that the Quit command be 
forwarded. It will also attempt to establish a connection with 
the collection program for data reporting. Failure to establish a 
connection with CmdCtrl or Collection need not be fatal, although 
the data-reporting functions will be useless without the 
Collection connection.<P>

It will then attempt to establish communications with the laser 
system. When communications are first established, the driver 
will query the laser system and report the contents of the EEPROM 
to Memo. It will also query the status history and output status 
codes starting with the latest Boot.<P>

With the initialization complete, the driver will register it's 
name (topaz) with the operating system, signaling other 
processes that the initialization was successful and advertising 
the command services to the command server.<P>

At this point, the driver enters server mode where it waits in a 
Receive() loop, waiting for incoming requests. The driver will 
handle the following messages:<P>
<DL>
<DT>Command Requests from Command Server
<DD>Supported commands include setting the diode current and the 
diode temperature and turning the diodes on or off.
<DT>Quit message from CmdCtrl (or topaz -q)
<DD>Causes the driver to terminate gracefully
<DT>Proxy from collection
<DD>Signals the driver to request the data set from the laser 
system and report it to collection.
<DT>Proxy from serial port
<DD>Signals the driver to read characters from the serial port, 
presumably to collect a response from a data request.
</DL>

The data to be report to telemetry include:
<UL>
<LI>Diode 1 Current
<LI>Diode 2 Current
<LI>Diode 1 Temperature
<LI>Diode 2 Temperature
<LI>Status History array (16 bytes)
<LI>Diode 1 Operating Hours
<LI>Diode 2 Operating Hours
</UL>

Any or all of this data may be reported in telemetry. The rate at 
which the data is collected and/or reported is entirely 
determined by the TMC program.<P>

When reading the data set, the data read from the laser system 
will be checked for sanity. If any characters appear to be 
missing or mis-formatted, the entire record will be rejected. A 
fixed number of rejected records may be written to the memo log 
in an ASCII format to facilitate debugging. A count of rejected 
records will be maintained and reported to Memo on termination.<P>

Whenever the data set is collected, the status history array is 
compared to the previously recorded array and any new status 
codes are output to Memo.<P>
