<h2><a id="P0">Introduction</a></h2>

<p><code>genui</code> is a code generator for processing engineering data within
the Anderson Group Data Acquisition System architecture. Based on a simple
configuration file, <code>genui</code> generates source code for data extraction and
a series of Matlab <code>.m</code> files for viewing the resulting data. Multiple
data channels can be displayed on each graph, and multiple graphs can be
stacked together in groups, making it easy to correlate events across a group
of related channels.</p>

<h2><a id="P1">Invocation</a></h2>
<blockquote><code>genui [-d matdir] [-c] inputfile</code></blockquote>
<dl><dt>-d matdir</dt>
  <dd>Specify directory where .m files will be written</dd>
  <dt>-c</dt>
  <dd>Generate .cdf file (for .csv output) instead of .edf (for .sps)</dd>
  <dt>inputfile</dt>
  <dd>The name of the configuration file.</dd>
</dl>

<p>When you run genui, it will generate a .cdf or .edf file from which
an extraction program can be compiled. The name of the output file is
the concatenation of the MNEMONIC (specified in the configuration file),
'eng' and the file type (.cdf or .edf).</p>

<p>In order to build the extraction program, you will need to add a
definition to the .spec file something like this:</p>

<blockquote><code>
ccengext : cceng.cdf
</code></blockquote>

<p>You may need to modify this rule to add additional files, and you will
also have to add an explicit rule for generating cceng.cdf.</p>

<h2><a id="P2">Configuration File</a></h2>

<p>The configuration file, frequently called <code>genui.txt</code>, has a
very simple format, consisting of only two line types:</p>
<ul><li>Keyword Definitions</li>
  <li>Data Definitions</li>
</ul>

<p>Keyword definition lines consist of a keyword followed by a space and
the keyword value. The keywords are:</p>
<dl><dt>HEADER</dt><dd>Value: Text to be displayed at the top of the Matlab GUI</dd>
<dt>MNEMONIC</dt><dd>Value: A short string uniquely associated with this
  instrument, used to create unique function and file names.</dd>
<dt>HOMEDIR</dt><dd>Value: The name of a function that will be used to locate
  where the data files are stored. The function itself will be generated the
  first time the generated GUI is run, but the name must be chosen to be
  unique to this experiment.</dd>
<dt>ROWS</dt><dd>Value: An integer specifying how many buttons should be listed
in each column of the GUI.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Data definition lines consist of the following elements separated by whitespace:</p>

<blockquote>&lt;Rate&gt; &lt;Mnc&gt;[:&lt;Var&gt;:&lt;bit&gt;]
  &lt;Group&gt; &lt;Graph&gt; [&lt;format&gt;] [:&lt;function&gt;]
  [&lt;legend_pos&gt;] [&lt;legend&gt;]</blockquote>

<dl>
<dt>Data Rate</dt><dd>The possibly fractional rate of the datum in Hz. Must be
  specified as an integer or a fraction.</dd>
<dt>Data Mnemonic</dt>
  <dd>The TM variable name. Bit-mapped digital status values can use the format
    <code><i>mnemonic</i>:<i>datum</i>:<i>bit_number</i></code>, where
    <i>datum</i> is the aggregate TM variable and <i>bit_number</i> is
    an integer, with zero representing the least significant bit. Digital
    status values cannot be combined on the same graph with analog channels,
    although they can be combined effectively within a group.
  </dd>
<dt>Group</dt><dd>The name of the group of related graphs. This usually
  will refer to a subsystem.</dd>
<dt>Graph</dt><dd>The name of the graph. Multiple data definition lines
  can refer to the same group and graph. Graphs in different groups
  can have the same name.</dd>
<dt>Format</dt><dd>Optional: a printf-style format for converting the value from
  a double type to text. The default is the same as the screen display format,
  but that needs to be overridden if the screen display is non-numeric.
  A format of '%-' disables extraction of the specified variable. This
  is to support backwards compatibility when TM variables are eliminated.</dd>
<dt>Function Name</dt><dd>Optional: If you want to add a fully custom graph
  to the GUI, you can provide a string beginning with a colon (<i>e.g.</i> ':foo').
  This is combined with the customization prefix ('cust_' followed by the MNEMONIC string)
  to create the name of the custom function.</dd>
<dt>Legend Position</dt>
  <dd>An optional four-element Matlab vector [x y h v] specifying the relative position and
      alignment of the graph's legend as specified by the nlegend() function.
      x and y specify the reference position, where
      [0 0] is the lower left corner and [1 1] is the upper right. h and v specify
      the horizontal and vertical alignment, respectively, with -1 specifying
      left or bottom alignment, 1 specifying top or right alignment and 0
      representing center alignment. Non-integer values are also supported.</dd>
<dt>Legend</dt><dd>Optional string to be used instead of the mnemonic in the
  graph's legend. Useful for eliminating a common prefix from a group of channels.</dd>
</dl>

<h2><a id="P3">Matlab Setup</a></h2>
    <p>There are three Matlab libraries you will need to install to run the
    engineering plot gui:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>nort: A set of general utility functions</li>
      <li>nort/ne: Functions for engineering plots</li>
      <li>The generated experiment-specific plot files.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Installation involves checking out the libraries from the appropriate
      source code repository and adding them to your Matlab path. The first
      thing you probably want to do is figure out where you want to locate
      these libraries. You probably want to create a common base directory
      for Matlab libraries. This could be a Matlab directory in "My Documents" or
      C:\Matlab. All three of these libraries could then be subdirectories
      of this root directory. On the other hand, you might have all of
      the experiment's source code checked out somewhere, so it might make sense
      to leave the experiment-specific engineering plot library where it is.</p>
    
    <p>To check out Nort's matlab libraries, bring up a shell, cd into your
      common base directory and:</p>
      <blockquote><code>
      cvs -d :ext:forge.abcd.harvard.edu:/cvsroot/arp-das co -d nort Matlab/nort</code>
      </blockquote>
     <p>or</p>
     <blockquote><code>
      cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@forge.abcd.harvard.edu:/cvsroot/arp-das login<br>
      cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@forge.abcd.harvard.edu:/cvsroot/arp-das co -d nort Matlab/nort
      </code></blockquote>
      
   <p>There are several directories included in this download, but only two that
      should be added to your Matlab path: nort and nort/ne. The others contain
      examples of installation-specific configuration hooks to make other parts
      of the libraries work.</p>
    
   <p>To download the experiment-specific engineering plots, you will need to
      refer to the source code repository for your instrument. Look for a README
      file in a directory named 'eng'.</p>
      
    <p>Add the libraries nort, nort/ne and the experiment-specific directory to your
    Matlab path.</p>
    
<h2><a id="P4">Data Setup</a></h2>

<p>Now you need to decide on a root directory for flight/run data.
   This directory will contain a subdirectory for each run using the same
   run numbering as under QNX. Each run directory will contain .mat files
   with all the engineering data. If you append an 'F' to the name of flight
   runs, then the plots will note that this is flight data.</p>

<p>The first time your run the instrument's engineering GUI, you will
be prompted to specify your data root directory. The directory name will
be stored using the file name specified with the HOMEDIR keyword in the
genui configuration file.</p>

<h2><a id="P5">Data Download</a></h2>

<p>Each time you make a data run, you will need to perform the following steps
in order to view the engineering plots:</p>

<ul>
<li>Run the data extraction</li>
<li>Transfer the data from QNX to your local machine</li>
<li>Convert the extracted data to .mat files</li>
<li>Run your experiment-specific GUI</li>
</ul>

<p>The exact order of these operations and the specific procedures you
need to follow are probably experiment-specific.      

<h2><a id="P6">Running the GUI</a></h2>
<p>The name of the GUI routine is 'ui_<MNEMONIC>', where <MNEMONIC>
is the value specified in the configuration file, <i>e.g.</i> 'ui_cc'.
Running 'ui_cc' in Matlab will bring up a GUI interface listing
all the graphs and groups and all of the data runs found in the
data directory. Select the run from the list on the right. The most
recent run is the default. Each button in the main area generates
a graph. The larger buttons represent groups that put multiple graphs
on one figure.</p>

<p>I have added some menu items to the graph displays:</p>
<dl><dt>Zoom:</dt>
  <dd> Added before Matlab added their zoom buttons, but still sometimes
    a little easier to use. Allows you to select horizontal or
    vertical zoom in one step.</dd>
  <dt>MatchX:</dt>
  <dd>After zooming in on an X-axis region in one graph, MatchX will
     zoom all the other graphs in the figure to the same X range.</dd>
  <dt>Edit:</dt>
  <dd>Allows you to further <a href="#PX">customize</a> the graphs.</dd>
  <dt>Expand:</dt>
  <dd>Allows you to open any of the graphs in a group in it's own figure.</dd>
</dl>

<h2><a id="P7">Customizations</a></h2>
<p>You will often want to further customize individual graphs. The use of
lines may be inappropriate on particularly noisy data, for example, or
the default limits may reflect a transient startup condition, not the
region of interest. You can create a customization function for any
graph by selecting the graph in the 'Edit' menu. The customization
function will contain a summary of the graph's definition and examples
of how you might want to modify it. The argument to this function
is a vector of graphic object handles.</p>

<p>Such modifications can be checked back in to the instrument's source
code repository to make them available
to other team members. Subsequent changes to genui.txt should not
overwrite these, although it is possible that major modifications to
the group and plot structure might result in name changes that would
defeat your modifications.</p>
