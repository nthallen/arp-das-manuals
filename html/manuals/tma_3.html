<p>In order to compile and run an algorithm, several steps need to
be taken in other source files. The rules for compilation need to
be enterred in the <a href="#P3.1">.spec file</a>, and the algorithm
needs to be invoked, either from the <a href="#P3.2">interact</a>
script, the <a href="#P3.3">doit</a> script, or <a href="#P3.4">both</a>.

</td></tr></table>

<h3><a name="P3.1">3.1</a>: .spec File Specification</h3>

<p>The .spec file defines how the algorithm is compiled,
including what other files must be included. The .spec file
is processed by <a href="appgen.html">appgen</a> to create
a standard <code>Makefile</code> which can in turn be
processed by <code>make</code> to compile any or all of
an instrument's software.</p>

<p>Algorithm executables have names that end in &quot;algo&quot;. Appgen
uses the name as one clue in determining what functionality to include.
[Other suffixes will work as well, but their use is discouraged
unless necessary as such use may break in future versions of appgen.
At present, suffixes &quot;disp&quot; and &quot;ext&quot; will work,
but certain other suffixes which have special meaning to appgen will
not.]</p>

<p>A minimal specification line for an algorithm defines the name
of the executable and the source file:</p>

<pre>    hsimalgo : hsim.tma
</pre>

<p>If the algorithm is split into more than one <code>.tma</code> file,
they should all be listed in the appropriate order. If the algorithm
depends on variables defined in <code>.tmc</code> files (other than those
in TMCBASE), those files should also be listed -- before the <code>.tma</code>
files.</p>

<p>If you need to compile your algorithm with a version of TMCALGO other
than the current default version, you can specify the version at the
end of your <code>.spec</code> file after the line consisting of the
string '%%':</p>

<pre>
hsimalgo : hsim.tma
...
%%
...
TMAREV=tmcalgoV2R1
...
</pre>

<p>What should be obvious as well is that command definitions,
specified via CMDBASE, are required in order to compile an
algorithm. TMCALGO will launch the command server in order to
verify the experiment-specific syntax of commands. Again,
it is possible to circumvent this behaviour at a low level,
but the point of <code>.tma</code> algorithms is to combine
telemetry data with commands.</p>

<p>As always, you must run <a href="appgen.html">appgen</a> after
editting your <code>.spec</code> file. Thereafter you should be
able to issue a '<code>make</code>' or '<code>make&nbsp;hsimalgo</code>'
to compile your algorithm.</p> 

<h3><a name="P3.2">3.2</a>: Interact/Runfile Specification</h3>

<p>For most experiments, it makes sense to run the algorithm
out of the &quot;flight&quot; script, <code>interact</code> or
<code>runfile.*</code>. (but see also <a href="#P3.4">dual-node
configuration</a>) The recommended command line and options
include:</p>

<pre>
    Launch - hsimalgo -vyl -c0 -C0 -b0 -i1
</pre>

<p>Launch is a shell function which starts processes in the
background and optionally waits for them to register a name.
The '-' after Launch indicates that the algo will not be
registering a name, so there is no need to wait. 'hsimalgo'
is the name of our algorithm.</p>

<p>'-vyl' is a shorthand for the
three separate options, '-v', '-y' and '-l':</p>

<ul>
<li><b>-v</b> suppresses
diagnostic output to the screen (we'll be sending the
diagnostics to the message log).</li>
<li><b>-y</b>
suppresses msg()'s
automatic <code><b>errno</b></code> analysis on log messages, which can be helpful,
but is often misleading.</li>
<li><b>-l</b>
requests the first level of
debug logging, which includes a message each time a new state
is entered. Adding additional '-l' options increases the
logging level, logging each command as it is sent to
the server, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>-c0</b>, <b>-C0</b> and <b>-b0</b> tell the algorithm on
which node to locate the message logger, the command server
and the DRing buffer respectively. '0' means the current node,
which is appropriate when running out of a flight script.</p>

<p><b>-i1</b> tells the algorithm to ask bfr to deliver one
row of data at a time. This is important in realtime processing,
since otherwise, the buffer is likely to save up rows of data
and deliver them in larger blocks. This would clearly have
a detrimental effect on carefully-timed procedures, since
the algorithm would be making decisions and issuing commands
based on older data.</p>

<p>There are a number of other command line options available
to algorithms (and it is even possible to add your own!). You
can examine all the options by issuing the command 'use hsimalgo'
(replacing hsimalgo with the name of your own algorithm!). We'll
use some of them in other configurations.</p>

<h3><a name="P3.3">3.3</a>: Doit Specification</h3>

<p>Under certain circumstances, it may be simpler to run the algorithm
out of the GSE 'doit' script. This may be true if you wish to switch
between two or more algorithms by invoking different doit scripts, for
example.</p>

<p>To run an algorithm out of a doit script, we simply add a line
to the '.doit' source file:</p>

<pre>
    algorithm hsimalgo -l
</pre>

<p>In general, the mkdoit2 compiler will take care of all the
standard command line options, including the code required to
identify the data acquisition node for the -b and -C options,
but you are still in control of the logging level via the
'-l' flag.</p>

<p>In laboratory settings this may be reasonable, particularly
where the same node is used for GSE and data acquisition. For flight
instruments, this approach is strongly discouraged, since it does not
exercise the instrument in a flight configuration. A recommended
alternative for selecting alternate algorithms is to use the .doit
command <a href="mkdoit2.html#P3.0"><code><b>batchfile</b></code></a>
to select a different flight script.</p>

<p>Another problem with running the algorithm out of the doit script
is that it ties the GSE more closely to the instrument; if you
<code><b>exit</b></code> from the GSE, the algorithm is terminated;
if you start up another GSE on another node, another copy of the
algorithm is started and two copies of each command will be issued.</p>

<h3><a name="P3.4">3.4</a>: Dual-node Configuration</h3>

<p>The downside to running the algorithm on the flight node is that
you don't get all the cool diagnostic information on your GSE
data screen. The simple solution to this problem is to run the
algorithm in both places: in the flight script to control the
instrument and in the doit script to display status information.
The critical distinction here is that the copy that runs out of
the doit script must not issue any commands. This is accomplished
by use of the <code><b>-p</b></code> option for 'playback':</p>

<pre>
    algorithm hsimalgo -p
</pre>

<p>In addition to suppressing any commands, mkdoit2 will suppress
all diagnostic messages from the local algorithm to avoid cluttering
the log file with duplicates. (This is done by omitting the -c option
on the command line.)</p>

<p>The configuration in the flight script remains the same as
specified in <a href="#P3.2">Section 3.2</a>.</p>

<p>This approach has some caveats as well. Fundamentally, The local
algorithm and the flight algorithm are not guaranteed to be
synchronized. This has the following implications:</p>

<ul>
<li>If both copies see exactly the same data from
the very start of the run, they will track reliably</li>
<li>If you exit from your GSE and later restart without
restarting the instrument, you local algorithm will be
out of synch with the flight algorithm.</li>
<li>If you start up other GSEs after the instrument
has been operating for a period of time, the new GSEs
will be out of synch with the flight algorithm.</li>
<li>If your algorithm has 'synchronization points',
it is possible to get these latecomers in line, but
an algorithm would have to be carefully designed to
accomplish this goal.</li>
</ul>

<p>The effect of de-synchronization is that commands
displayed locally will not be the same as the commands
which are actually being executed on the flight node.
This can lead to considerable confusion if you aren't
aware of the possibility. When in doubt, refer to the
instrument log file, which records the commands that
are actually being executed.</p>

<h3><a name="P3.5">3.5</a>: Playback Configuration</h3>

<p>It can be very useful to run an algorithm in playback mode,
particularly when trying to diagnose instrument misbehaviour.
Specification of the algorithm in a
<a href="mkdoit2.html#P2.2.1">playback <code>.doit</code></a>
file is basically identical to the dual-node configuration
except that you will probably want to add a '-ll' option to
have the playback algorithm log the commands it <i>would</i>
execute if it had control:</p>

<pre>
    algorithm hsimalgo -p -ll
</pre>

<h3><a name="P3.6">3.6</a>: Extraction</h3>

<p>You can also replay flight algorithms against logged data using
<a href="../guides/das_user.html#P3.3">extract</a>. As with playback,
it is important to pass the '-p' option, and '-ll' is probably required
if you hope to get useful information in the log. (Of course you might
be running your algorithm for other side effects...)</p>

<p>Note that when specifying command line arguments to an algorithm
for extract, you must enclose the algorithm and its arguments in
quotes:</p>

<pre>
    extract 010130.1 &quot;hsimalgo -pll&quot;
</pre>
