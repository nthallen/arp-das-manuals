<p>For the purposes of this tutorial, we will use a simulated
heater control system. Among other things, this system allows
us to set the heater current and the heater thermal mass.</p>
</td></tr></table>
<p>The simplest algorithms are just timed sequences of commands:</p>

<pre>
        State Init {
                &gt; Telemetry Start
             +5 &gt; Set Heater Current 0
                &gt; Set Heater Thermal Mass 1
        }
</pre>

<p>Here &quot;Telemetry Start&quot;, &quot;Set Heater Current 0&quot;, and &quot;Set
Heater Thermal Mass 1&quot; are all commands which are defined
via a <a href="cmdgen.html">CMDGEN</a> program, and can be
issued interactively at the keyboard. The '&gt;' character
introduces these experiment commands, which continue to the end
of the line. There may be leading spaces before the first
character of the command, but within the command the spelling and
spacing must match the defined command exactly or a syntax error
will be reported. (see also section
<a href="tma_6.html#P6.5.1">6.5.1</a>.) The <code><b>&quot;+5&quot;
</b></code> indicates that the following command should be
issued 5 seconds after the previous command.</p>

<p>So far this algorithm starts up the system and initializes
some parameters, but it hasn't done anything interesting. Let's
add some heat to the system:</p>

<table cellpadding="10">
<tr><td>
<pre>
        State Init {
                &gt; Telemetry Start
             +5 &gt; Set Heater Current 0
                &gt; Set Heater Thermal Mass 1
             +5 &gt; Set Heater Current 5
             +5 &gt; Set Heater Current 0
        }
</pre>
</td>
<td align="CENTER" valign="MIDDLE">Graph of Heater Pulse goes here</td></tr></table>

<p>Now we've got a 5-second pulse of current, and a plot of the
resulting current and temperature, but once is never enough. What
will happen if we keep pulsing the current at 5-second intervals?
To find out, we could duplicate the last two heater current lines
as many times as desired, but we can do better by defining a new
state.</p>

<h3><a name="P2.1">2.1</a>: States</h3>

<p>Basic program control flow is accomplished by grouping
commands into different states. Control is passed to the
beginning of a new state by use of the
<a href="tma_6.html#P6.5.3"><code><b>Validate</b></code></a> command.
A simple loop can be created by validating the current state,
causing command execution to begin again from the top.</p>

<p>Let's move our current pulse into a new state called
&quot;Pulse&quot; and make an endless loop:</p>

<table cellpadding="10">
<tr><td>
<pre>
        State Init {
                &gt; Telemetry Start
             +5 &gt; Set Heater Current 0
                &gt; Set Heater Thermal Mass 1
             +5 Validate Pulse;
        }

        State Pulse {
                &gt; Set Heater Current 5
             +5 &gt; Set Heater Current 0
             +5 Validate Pulse;
        }
</pre>
</td>
<td align="CENTER"><img src="tma_hs1.gif" width=98 height=242 border=0 alt="State Diagram" hspace=20></td></tr></table>

<p>Endless loops are not as unreasonable as they might be in other
sorts of programs since we reserve the option of issuing a &quot;Quit&quot;
command from the keyboard. In the lab, we might well want to set up a
sequence of operations for continuous repetition to give us time to
explore the behaviour of the system.</p>

<h3><a name="P2.2">2.2</a>: Accessing Telemetry Data</h3>

<p>On the other hand, loops that aren't endless are also useful.
Suppose we want to explore the behaviour of our heater system
with continual pulses while steadily increasing the heater's thermal
mass, but we wish to stop when the mass reaches 10. If the thermal
mass is stored in a variable named <code><b>Ct</b></code>, the
following code would do the trick:</p>

<table cellpadding="10">
<tr><td>
<pre>
        State Pulse {
                &gt; Set Heater Current 5
             +5 &gt; Set Heater Current 0
             +5 &gt; Add .2 to Heater Thermal Mass
                { if ( Ct &gt;= 10 ) Validate Idle;
                  else Validate Pulse;
                }
        }
		
        State Idle {}
 </pre>
</td>
<td align="CENTER"><img src="tma_hs2.gif" width=151 height=283 border=0 alt="State Diagram" hspace=20></td></tr></table>

<p>In this case, state <code><b>Idle</b></code> simply stops issuing commands, but
it is easy to see how it might move on to other operations. Some points that are
worth noting about this example:</p>

<ul>
<li>The code inside the inner curly braces is actually <a href="tmc.html">TMC</a>
code. The TMCALGO compiler does not look inside these curly braces; it just passes
them through verbatim to the <code>.tmc</code> output file, surrounding them with other
appropriate TMC constructs. Although <code><b>Validate</b></code> outside of
curly braces is a valid TMCALGO keyword, it is also a valid TMC keyword, and
that is how it is used in this example.</li>

<li>The relative location of a TMC statement inside a state affects when and
how often the TMC statement will be executed. For more information, see
the reference section on <a href="tma_6.html#P6.4">untimed commands</a>.</li>

<li>Since TMC code is in turn compiled into C code, virtually any C statement
can be placed inside a TMCALGO program. In addition to <code><b>Validate</b></code>,
some other things that might be usefully done inside a TMC statement include:</li>
<ul>
<li>Call <a href="libref/nl_error.html">nl_error()</a> or msg() to write useful
information, warnings or errors to the experiment log file.</li>
<li>Modify a local variable for use in other operations.</li>
<li>Invoke a more complicated C subroutine included in a separate module.</li>
</ul>

</ul>

<h3><a name="P2.3">2.3</a>: Partitions</h3>

<p>In a simple algorithm, only one state is valid at a time, so
validating another state discontinues processing of the current
state. As algorithms grow more complex, it becomes desirable to
allow processing in more than one state at a time. This is where
partitions come in.</p>

<p>Partitions break the algorithm up into separate groups of
states. Within each partition, exactly one
state is active at a time, but this means that there are as many
states active simultaneously as there are partitions.</p>

<p>Partitions can be entirely independent or tightly coupled as
the case requires. States in one partition can be validated from
another partition, and statements in one partition can
<a href="tma_6.html#P6.4">depend on</a> states in another partition.
When a state in another partition is validated, control flow in
the current partition is not affected, but the control flow of
the other partition is shifted to the new state regardless of
its present status.</p>

<p>One useful application for multiple partitions is
supervisory routines that watch for out-of-range conditions
independent of the current processing state. Suppose we
want to watch for an over-temperature condition on our
heater:</p>

<table cellpadding="10">
<tr><td>
<pre>
State Init {
        &gt; Telemetry Start
     +5 &gt; Set Heater Current 0
        &gt; Set Heater Thermal Mass 1
     +5 Validate Watch_Temp;
        Validate Pulse;
}

State Pulse {
        &gt; Set Heater Current 5
     +5 &gt; Set Heater Current 0
     +5 &gt; Add .2 to Heater Thermal Mass
        { if ( Ct &gt;= 10 ) Validate Idle;
          else Validate Pulse;
        }
}

State OverTemp {
        &gt; Set Heater Current 0
        { msg( 2,
           &quot;Heater over temperature&quot; ); }
        Validate Idle;
}

State Idle {}

PARTITION

State Watch_Idle {}

State Watch_Temp {
  { if ( THtr &gt; 100 ) {
      Validate OverTemp;
      Validate Watch_Idle;
    }
  }
}
</pre>

<h3><a name="P2.4">2.4</a>: Embedding C Code</h3>

<p>It is often useful to take advantage of the fact that TMCALGO compiles
TMC code which compiles to C code. TMCALGO contains features which allow
you to embed TMC or C code directly inside your TMCALGO program, often
eliminating the need to create a separate file for a simple definition.</p>

<p>As we have seen, TMC code can be embedded inside a state using curly
braces. TMC code may also appear outside of any state usinig curly braces.
In this case, the outer set of curly braces are removed before the code
is written to the <code>.tmc</code> file, allowing top-level TMC definitions
to be made. [This is in violation of normal scoping conventions, of course,
and a more sophisticated compiler would be able to handle TMC statements
outside of states without enclosing curly braces, but this approach allows
the desired results and was easily achievable.]</p>

<p>TMC allows the embedding of C statements (which are otherwise invisible
to the TMC compiler) by use of &quot;%{&quot; and &quot;%}&quot; bracketing.
TMCALGO uses the same <a href="#QUOTED-C-CODE">convention</a>, and passes the
entire block, delimeters included, to the <code>.tmc</code> output. This
eliminates the need for double-quoting of C-statements in TMCALGO.</p>

<h3><a name="P2.5">2.5</a>: Displaying Status</h3>

<p>Algorithms can generate useful status displays when run from a
<a href="tma_3.html#P3.3">doit script</a>. The status includes
information about each partition, what the current state is,
what command is going to be executed next and how long before
it is executed. The status display requires two rows on the screen
for each displayed partition. You can select which partitions
are displayed and where by defining appropriate fields in the
corresponding <code><b>.tbl</b></code> or <code><b>.fld</b></code>
files.</p>

<p>As mentioned in the <a href="mkdoit2.html#P2.3">mkdoit2 manual</a>,
data fields with names of the form:</p>

<pre>
    %TMA:<i>&lt;algo&gt;</i>:<i>&lt;partition number&gt;</i>
</pre>

<p>will be interpreted as defining space for status reports for the
named <i>algo</i> and <i>partition number</i>, where partitions
are implicitly numbered starting with 1. The specified fields must
span the entire width of the display and require two rows.</p>

<p>Defining such fields is most easily accomplished by using
<a href="table.html">table</a>. An appropriate table field specification
for the first partition of our <code>hsimalgo</code> would be:</p>

<pre>
    (%TMA:hsimalgo:1,0+1,2);
</pre>

<p>The elements after the field name are the width and length, respectively
of the resulting field. '0+1' indicates the field has no minimum width, but
should be stretched to be as wide as possible. '2' indicates that exactly
two rows are required.</p>

<p>If you are going to use the same data display with different algorithms
at different times, you may want to take advantage of table's
<a href="table.html#Overlay">Overlay</a> feature optimize your use of
screen real estate.</p>

<p>It is safe to assume that you can display any partition's status on any
display. Strictly speaking, there are some restrictions, but they are difficult
to explain and have yet to be a problem. If you run into trouble, talk to
Norton.</p>
