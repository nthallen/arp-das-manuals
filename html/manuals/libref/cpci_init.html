<h1>cpci_init</h1>
<h2>Synopsis</h2>
<pre>
    
    #include "analogic.h"
    
    Server_Def *cpci_init( char *name );
    int cpci_setup( Server_Def *cpci, analogic_setup_t *setup );
    int cpci_stop( Server_Def *cpci );
    int cpci_quit( Server_Def *cpci );
    
</pre>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These functions provide an API for controlling the drivers for
the Analogic high-speed A/D boards. The boards we are supporting
are called the CPCI-16 and the CPCI-14, so I have used the 'cpci'
prefix for these functions. Of course 'cpci' refers to the form
factor, "Compact PCI", and is not specific to Analogic or A/D
conversion, but I'll ignore that for lack of a better short
mnemonic.
</p>
<p>Since we anticipate supporting more than one board in a system,
we will likewise anticipate more than one server in a system.
Whereas other client APIs in nortlib can maintain a single static
Server_Def structure out of view, we'll need to create them
dynamically. cpci_init() performs this dynamic creation, taking a
single argument, the server's short name, e.g. "cpci14". The
programmer may choose to call <a href="CltSend.html">CltInit</a>() after callingcpci_init(), although that is optional.
</p>
<p>cpci_setup() requests that the driver configure the board for
data acquisition using the parameters in the setup structure.
The structure is defined as:
</p>
<pre>
    typedef struct {
      unsigned long FSample;
      unsigned long NSample;
      unsigned long NReport;
      unsigned long NAvg;
      unsigned short NCoadd;
      unsigned short FTrigger;
      unsigned short Options;
    } analogic_setup_t;
</pre>
<p>FSample is the sample frequency in Hz. This rate must be
supported by the selected board.
</p>
<p>NSample is the number of samples to take per trigger at the
specified sample frequency.
</p>
<p>NReport is how many points to report. This should be equal
to or evenly divide NSample.
</p>
<p>NAvg applies when Fit Analysis is selected. It defines the number
of sequential reduced data points that are averaged together into
each report bin. NAvg*NReport*NCoadd*NSample is the total number of
raw points that would go into a report with Fit Analysis. Without
Fit Analsys, only NCoadd*NSample raw samples are required.
</p>
<p>NCoadd is the number of passes that should be coadded into the
report before it is recorded. Coadding is essentially vector
addition for summing repeating waveforms.
</p>
<p>Options is a bit-mapped word that selects which channels should
be collected and/or reported and whether a specific analysis
should be performed on the data. The bits are:
</p>
<pre>
    ANLG_OPT_A:   Collect Channel A
    ANLG_OPT_B:   Collect Channel B
    ANLG_OPT_C:   Collect Channel C
    ANLG_OPT_D:   Collect Channel D
    ANLG_OPT_FIT: Perform time constant analysis
</pre>
<p>OPT_FIT applies to the CPCI14 only and is used in ringdown modes
to reduce the ringdowns to a single time constant. OPT_C and
OPT_D are only valid with the CPCI16, since the CPCI14 only has
two channels.
</p>
<p>cpci_stop() requests the driver to suspend data acquisition. This
is required before reconfiguring the board.
</p>
<p>cpci_quit() requests the driver to terminate.
