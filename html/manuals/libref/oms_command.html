<h1>oms_command</h1>
<h2>Synopsis</h2>
<pre>
    #include "omsdrv.h"
    int oms_init( void );
    int oms_command( USHRT function, char *cmd, USHRT n_req, char *buf );
    int oms_shutdown( void );
    int oms_read(char *cmd, USHRT n_req, char *buffer );
    int oms_write( char *cmd );
    
</pre>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>  <P>These functions provide basic client access to omsdrv, the
  driver for the Oregon Micro Systems PC68 Motor Controller
  Board.
</p>
<p>  <P>oms_init() provides the standard client/server
  initialization. As usual, it is optional, but calling it at
  startup might flag an error condition sooner than if you wait
  until the first OMS command to find out.</P>
</p>
<p>  <P>oms_command() is the main routine for client communication
  with the OMS driver, omsdrv. oms_shutdown(), oms_read() and
  oms_write() are all implemented via macros which invoke
  oms_command(). The function codes are defined in omsdrv.h.
  cmd is the exact command string that should be written out to
  the PC68 board. n_req specifies the number of atomic responses
  expected from the board, and is only applicable for read
  requests. (If you expect results you wish to ignore, we'll need
  to amend this rule.) buf is a buffer into which the result
  string is written, stripped of lf-cr prefixes and suffixes. It
  is the client's responsibility to make sense out of the string.
  </P>
</p>
<p>  <P>oms_shutdown() attempts to locate a resident omsdrv and
  request that it shut down.</P>
</p>
<p>  <P>oms_read() is used to issue a command to the PC68 when a
  reply is expected. It uses all the arguments of oms_command().
  </P>
</p>
<p>  <P>oms_write() is used to issue commands to the PC68 which
  do not produce a reply.
</p>
<h2>Returns</h2>
<p>  All functions return 0 on success. oms_command() returns 1 if
  the function code is unrecognized by the server and -1 if the
  server cannot be located or the reply does not have the correct
  signature. The response level for this driver is 2, so most
  errors will produce an error complaint but won't be fatal,
  although oms_command() will abort no matter what if you pass it
  invalid arguments.
