<h2>Description</h2>
<p>  <P>NCAR_set_mass() causes both of the D/A channels on the RF
  board to be written. The mass parameter is in .1 AMU units,
  i.e. 10 represents 1 AMU. This function uses three pairs of
  constants to calculate the appropriate output values by a
  simple slope-intercept formula. The constants may be changed
  via NCAR_set_gain(), with the appropriate addresses defined in
  the header file.</P>
</p>
<h2>Returns</h2>
<p>  <P>Most functions return 0 on success. Failures are generally
  non-fatal. Read functions return values appropriate to the
  device being read. The client is responsible for converting the
  raw value to reasonable units, which may involve converting the
  unsigned value to a signed value.</P>
