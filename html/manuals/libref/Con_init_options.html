<h1>Con_init_options</h1>
<h2>Synopsis</h2>
<pre>
    
    #include "nl_cons.h"
    void Con_init_options(int argcc, char **argvv);
    
</pre>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>  Con_init_options() processes the command line arguments for the
  Nortlib Console Functions. The two arguments supported are 'A'
  and 'a'. Both take an argument which is the name of the console
  device to open. By default, the first console is that
  associated with the standard output, but it can be redefined by
  use of the 'A' option. The 'a' option defines the second and
  all subsequent consoles. If any device argument is '-', that
  console is not opened and subsequent output to that index will
  be supressed.<P>
</p>
<p>  After each console is opened, an attempt is made
  to contact getcon to release the console. The 'g' option
  supresses this release request for consoles appearing later in
  the command line. This might be appropriate for short-lived
  programs such as scrpaint (if it used nl_cons) where it is
  desirable for getcon to keep the console open.<P>
</p>
<p>  At present, these functions support only QNX consoles. At some
  point in the future, they may be switched over to use terminfo
  and hence support arbitrary terminal types.
