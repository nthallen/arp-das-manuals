<h1>cache_init</h1>
<h2>Synopsis</h2>
<pre>
    #include "da_cache.h"
    
    void cache_init( nid_t node );
    int cache_write( unsigned short addr, unsigned short value );
    int cache_writev( unsigned short a, unsigned short n_bytes,
                      char *data );
    int cache_lwrite( unsigned short addr, unsigned long value );
    int cache_fwrite( unsigned short addr, float value );
    unsigned short cache_read( unsigned short addr );
    unsigned short cache_readv( unsigned short a, unsigned short l,
                                char *data );
    unsigned long cache_lread( unsigned short addr );
    float cache_fread( unsigned short addr );
    int cache_quit( void );
    
</pre>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These routines provide access to the da_cache driver.
cache_init() identifies the node on which the da_cache driver is
located. If cache_init() is not called, the driver will be sought
on the local node.
</p>
<p>cache_*write*() sets the value at the specified address(es). If
the address is within the hardware address range specified when
the driver was started, the value is masked with CACHE_HW_MASK
and then written out to the subbus address. If there is no
acknowledge from the hardware, the cached value is or-ed with
CACHE_NACK_MASK, which can be checked on read. The l and f
versions call cache_writev() with appropriate arguments.
</p>
<p>cache_*read*() reads the stored value for the specified address. It
does not touch hardware, even for addresses within the hardware
range. The l and f versions call cache_readv() with appropriate
arguments.
</p>
<p>cache_quit() sends a quit request to a resident cache driver.
</p>
<p>All of these functions use the standard nortlib client/server
routines, which means their behaviour can by modified by setting
<a href="nl_response.html">nl_response</a>, but the default response is set to "warn", soyou'll need to check your return codes.
</p>
<h2>Returns</h2>
<p>cache_*write*(), cache_readv() and cache_quit() return the
following status codes defined in da_cache.h:
</p>
<p><UL>
<LI>CACHE_E_OK: Success
<LI>CACHE_E_UNKN: Invalid Command Type
<LI>CACHE_E_OOR: Invalid Address
<LI>CACHE_E_NACK: No acknowledge
<LI>CACHE_E_NOCACHE: Driver not found
</UL>
</p>
<p>cache_*read() returns the value associated with the specified
address. If the address is invalid, ~0 is returned. Values for
hardware addresses will include acknowledge information in the
CACHE_NACK_MASK bit. It is fairly easy to confuse the invalid
return values with data values, particularly for the l and f
versions.
