<h1>mlf_init</h1>
<h2>Synopsis</h2>
<pre>
    
      #include "mlf.h"
      mlf_def_t *mlf_init( int n_levels, int n_files, int writing,
    	  char *fbase, char *fsuffix, char *config );
    
</pre>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>  The multi-level file routines are designed for efficiently
  storing a large number of sequential files. Most hierarchical
  file systems become seriously inefficient as the number of
  files in a single directory becomes large. This is due in large
  part to the fact that any search for a specific filename
  requires a linear search through the directory, and hence
  sequentially accessing each file in a directory is an order n^2
  operation.
</p>
<p>  The MLF routines address this issue by using multiple directory
  levels to store sequential files. The number of levels and the
  number of entries at each level is configurable, depending on
  the total expected number of files.
</p>
<p>  mlf_init() establishes the parameters for subsequent
  multi-level file operations. n_levels specifies how many levels
  of directories should be used. n_files specifies the number of
  files per directory. the writing argument should be non-zero
  for write operations, zero for read operations. fbase is the
  name of the first level directory. fsuffix is a suffix that is
  appended to each file. config is an optional string defining
  the first file to access. The base and suffix in the config
  string takes precedence over the fbase and fsuffix parameters.
</p>
<p>  Generated file names are of the form:
</p>
<p>  $fbase/\d\d+(/\d\d)* /\d\d\.$fsuffix
</p>
<h2>Returns</h2>
<p>  mlf_init() returns a pointer to a dynamically allocated
  structure which holds the definitions. Most errors are syntax
  errors and are fatal, although they can be made non-fatal
  by manipulating <a href="nl_response.html">nl_response</a>.</p>
