<H1>RTG: Real Time Graphing Utility</H1>

<H2>Synopsis</H2>
<Pre>
  rtg [ -f filename ]
       -f  Read in the specified configuration file.
</Pre>

<H2>FUNCTION</H2>

rtg provides a graphing solution for the <A HREF="../index.html">ARP
Data Acquisition Environment</A>.
Running under QNX Windows, rtg can produce real time trend graphs for any
data collected from an instrument, including values synthesized from
multiple channels and data extracted into SNAFU spreadsheets.

<H2>Where to get rtg</H2>

For starters, rtg requires QNX Windows, which is a windowing environment
which runs under the QNX Operating System, the platform of choice for ARP
Data Acquisition. If your node isn't configured for QNX Windows, ask your
system adminstrator(s) to configure it for you and show you the basics of
getting in and out of windows.

<P>Once your node is configured, you can obtain the latest
release of rtg by running <A HREF="osupdate.html">osupdate</A>. (If
your node is configured to run windows off of the server, you
will always have the latest release!)

<P>If your system adminstrators have done their job, you should be able to
bring up rtg using the Programs menu item.

<H2>Basics</H2>

By default, rtg comes up with a blank window titled "RTG1". rtg windows
consist of a "Frame" surrounding the "Pane" where the graphs will appear.
If you press the menu button while the cursor is in the frame, you will
see the standard "Open Look" window menu. You can use this menu to
manipulate the windows themselves as well as to quit rtg altogether. If
you press the menu button while the cursor is in the pane, you will see
the basic menu for rtg. This is the menu you will use to create and modify
your graphs.

<P>The basic objects of rtg are windows, channels, axes and graphs. As a
rule, you can create, delete or edit the properties of any of these
objects. If you bring up the pane menu (press "menu" with the cursor in
the pane, remember?) you will see items for Graph, Channel and Window.
(For now, you access the axes through the graph properties.) Each of these
items has a submenu containing Properties, Create, amd Delete. Some of the
selections will be dim, meaning you cannot select them, usually for
obvious reasons; you can't delete a graph if there are no graphs to
delete, for example.

<H2>Windows</H2>

<P>Select "Window Create" from the pane menu. Another window will appear
titled "RTG2". If you select "Window Delete", the window will disappear,
along with any graphs defined in it. If you delete the last window, rtg
will terminate. You can reposition a window on the screen by pressing the
select button anywhere on the frame and dragging the window to the desired
location. You can change the size of a window by pressing select on any of
the corners of the frame and dragging the corner until the window is the
desired size. It is possible you may want to make some windows quite small
in order to fit more information onto a screen.

<P>You can modify other properties of a window by selecting "Window
Properties..." from the pane menu. This brings up another menu asking you
which window's properties you wish to edit, followed by a dialog window
displaying the selected window's properties. Using this dialog, you can
change the title of the window, specify that the title not be displayed or
that the window should always be kept at the "front" of the display, on
top of any other windows. When you have specified the properties you want,
select the "Apply" button, and the changes will take effect. If you decide
not to make any changes, you can select "Reset".

<H2>Channels</H2>

<P>Before you can create a graph, you must define a "channel". A channel is
the basic unit of data that rtg recognizes. Each channel is a sequence of
data pairs. For real time data, this is usually a data channel paired with
the time the data was collected. For SNAFU spreadsheets, this is a column
of data paired with the data in column 0.

<P>To create a channel from a spreadsheet, select "Channel Create
Spreadsheet" from the pane menu. This brings up a file menu from which you
can select an appropriate spreadsheet. If you don't have one handy, There
is a sample in the rtg distribution. Select the "Path" button and enter
/windows/apps/rtg and press "Enter". You should now see the file scan.sps
in the menu. Select that file and then select "Open" and you will have
succeeded in defining five channels, one for each of columns 1 through 5
in scan.sps.

<P>Channels for realtime data are defined by the extraction
programs which send the data to rtg. These are usually generated
with the <A HREF="tmg.html">TMG</A> preprocessor. When the extraction
program is running, all the extracted channels will be defined
automatically.

<P>You can manipulate a channel's properties just like a window's properties
via the "Channel Properties..." menu item. At the moment, a channel's
properties consist of the name of the units for the channel's X and Y
components. The units are important for determining whether graphs should
share axes or not. By default, two graphs will share an axis if they have
the same units. Also by default, most channels are created with their
units defined to be the same as the name of the channel, so most channels
therefore do not share units with other channels. Hence, if you want two
channels to be plotted on the same axis, you will have to edit their
properties so they have the same units.

<H2>Graphs</H2>

<P>Now that you have some channels, you can create some graphs. Select "Graph
Create" from the pane menu, then select the channel you wish to graph.
With any luck, you will see a graph of the data in question. Now create
another graph. You will see that the graphs "stack up" inside the window.
This is the default behaviour, but it is by no means the only option. By
default, the axes are scaled to include all the data in the channel, but
this can also be changed by editing the graph's properties. That's right,
select "Graph Properties..." from the pane menu. To adjust the options of
a graph's axes, select "X Axis" or "Y Axis" from the graph properties
dialog.

<P>From the graph properties dialog, you can change the graph's name, the
line color and thickness, the symbol and the symbol's color. The axis
properties present numerous options pertaining to the axes, include the
name, units, min and max limits, auto scaling, axis positioning and
triggering modes.
