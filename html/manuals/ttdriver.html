<H2><a id="Intro">1</A>: Introduction</H2>

ttdriver is a QNX driver for the Tommy Thompson data acquisition 
boards. It consists of an executable program (ttdriver) which 
interfaces to the hardware and a library of C functions which 
communicate with the driver to supply applications with all the 
functionality of the Thompson Stack. The library functions 
communicate with the driver via QNX messages. As such, there is a 
C-level interface and a message-level interface.

<H2><a id="Invoc">2</A>: Invocation</H2>
<PRE>    ttdriver [options]
             -c &lt;node&gt; send msgs to memo on specified node
             -e &lt;error filename&gt;
             -h &lt;msg header&gt;
             -l add a level of debug messages
             -o &lt;dev&gt;[,&lt;r&gt;,&lt;c&gt;,&lt;w&gt;,&lt;pass&gt;,&lt;warn&gt;,&lt;fail&gt;,&lt;debug&gt;]
             -q Ask resident ttdriver to terminate
             -s no message sounds
             -v disable verbose to stderr
             -y disable system error message concatenation to messages
</PRE>

ttdriver is usually run in the background. It may either be 
invoked at boot time out of /etc/config/sysinit.$NODE or at 
runtime via and "interact" or "runfile" script. The -q option is 
the most graceful way to get ttdriver to terminate from the 
command line. There is also a library function to ask the 
resident ttdriver to terminate. If run from the sysinit.$NODE, 
there may be no reason to have ttdriver terminate at all.<P>

All the other options pertain to memo messages and are identical 
to the options on all other executables in this architecture.<P>

Note that if ttdriver is run from sysinit.$NODE, it will be 
invoked before any memo program is resident, so it will not be 
able to log its messages with memo. In this case the appropriate 
invocation will likely be "ttdriver -v &amp;".

<H2><a id="CLevel">3</A>: C-Level Interface</H2>

   unsigned short <A HREF="ttlib.html#tt_init">tt_init</A>( void );
</PRE>

This function makes contact with the ttdriver. It is usually 
unnecessary, since each of the other functions will make the 
initial contact if necessary, but it is often desirable to find 
out whether the driver is present before you actually need it.

<H3><a id="C_atod">3.2</A>: A/D Functions</H3>

<PRE>
   unsigned short <A HREF="ttlib.html#tt_read_atod">tt_read_atod</A>( unsigned short channel );
</PRE>

<H3><a id="C_dig">3.3</A>: Digital I/O Functions</H3>

<PRE>
   unsigned short <A HREF="ttlib.html#tt_write_digital">tt_write_digital</A>( unsigned short dig_word,
             unsigned short value );
   unsigned short <A HREF="ttlib.html#tt_read_digital">tt_read_digital</A>( unsigned short dig_word );

   unsigned short <A HREF="ttlib.html#tt_scdc_multcmd">tt_scdc_multcmd</A>( unsigned char *cmds );
</PRE>

<H3><a id="C_gc">3.4</A>: GC Board Functions</H3>

<PRE>
   unsigned short <A HREF="ttlib.html#tt_gc_reset">tt_gc_reset</A>( void );
   unsigned short <A HREF="ttlib.html#tt_gc_byte">tt_gc_byte</A>( void );
   unsigned short <A HREF="ttlib.html#tt_gc_read">tt_gc_read</A>( gc_data_buf *gcbuf );
   unsigned long <A HREF="ttlib.html#tt_gc_chan">tt_gc_chan</A>( unsigned short chan );
</PRE>

These four functions actually define three totally distinct ways 
of accessing the GC counter board.
<A HREF="ttlib.html#tt_gc_reset">tt_gc_reset</A>() is required 
before any of the other functions are called, and is generally 
required before switching from one method to another.<P>

<A HREF="ttlib.html#tt_gc_byte">tt_gc_byte</A>() is the lowest 
level routine, and reads a single byte of data from the GC board. 
Detailed knowledge of the GC counter board architecture is 
required in order to make use of this function.<P>

<A HREF="ttlib.html#tt_gc_read">tt_gc_read</A>() returns all of 
the data currently available from the GC board for all channels 
in the gc_data_buf structure. The details of the contents of the 
structure are noted in the <A HREF="#MsgLevel">Message-Level 
Interface</A> section. Since the GC board has an microprocessor 
of its own, it can buffer up to two seconds worth of data. That 
means you could call this function every second or two and still 
get all the data. On the other hand, you would have to write some 
non-trivial code to deal with these chunks of data when they 
arrive.<P>

<A HREF="ttlib.html#tt_gc_chan">tt_gc_chan</A>() is the simplest
interface to the GC board. It returns the single latest value 
available from the GC board for the specified channel. In order 
not to lose data, this function must be called at the GC board's 
data rate (8 Hz).

<H3><a id="C_dtoa">3.5</A>: D/A Functions</H3>

<PRE>
   unsigned short <A HREF="ttlib.html#tt_dac_out">tt_dac_out</A>( unsigned short channel, unsigned short value );
   unsigned short <A HREF="ttlib.html#tt_dac_in">tt_dac_in</A>( unsigned short channel );
   unsigned short <A HREF="ttlib.html#tt_dac_enbl">tt_dac_enbl</A>( unsigned short safe );
</PRE>

These three functions are the interface to
<A HREF="http://www.cmdl.noaa.gov/noah_home/personel/dunn1.html">
Ray Dunn</A>'s Digital to 
Analog board. <A HREF="ttlib.html#tt_dac_out">tt_dac_out</A>( 
channel, value ) writes the specified value to the specified 
channel, returning zero on success and 0xFFFF if the channel 
number is out of range.<P>

<A HREF="ttlib.html#tt_dac_in">tt_dac_in</A>( channel ) returns the 
last value written to the specified channel or 0xFFFF if the 
channel number is out of range.<P>

<A HREF="ttlib.html#tt_dac_enbl">tt_dac_enbl</A>() determines 
whether the programmed values are enabled to the outputs of the 
D/A board.

<H3><a id="C_ctr">3.6</A>: Counter Board Functions</H3>

At the present time, there is no support for the standard Thompson
Stack counter board, though the effort to add such support is
deemed to be trivial.

<H2><a id="MsgLevel">4</A>: Message-Level Interface</H2>

When starting up, ttdriver registers the name huarp/exp/ttdriver, 
where "exp" is the experiment mnemonic (e.g. "acats") (huarp is 
the acronym for the folks who wrote the program) Application 
programs can use that name to locate the driver and establish 
message communications.<P>

ttdriver will also register the name huarp/exp/scdc in order to 
mimic the HUARP scdc program. Soldrv will use this name to locate 
ttdriver in order to cycle digital commands efficiently.<P>

ttdriver will recognize two types of messages: the new 
board-specific messages and the scdc messages.<P>

The board-specific messages use the following structure. The 
first two bytes of the message are a signature to uniquely 
identify the message. The SCDC interface was defined before this 
sort of convention was established, so the SCDC message structure 
is different. Fortunately, we have not run into any sort of 
conflict to date.<P>

Each special function has a different function code enumerated in 
the ttmsgtype. Most functions require an address, and many 
require data. If a function does not require one or the other, it 
need not be sent.<P>

<PRE>
          typedef struct {
            unsigned short signature;   /* 'tt' */
            unsigned short function; /* ttmsgtype */
            unsigned short address;
            unsigned short data;
          } Send_to_tt;

          typedef enum {
            TTMSG_READ_ATOD,
            TTMSG_WRITE_DIGITAL,
            TTMSG_READ_DIGITAL,
            TTMSG_GC_RESET,
            TTMSG_GC_BYTE,
            TTMSG_GC_READ,
            TTMSG_GC_CHAN,
            TTMSG_DAC_OUT,
            TTMSG_DAC_IN,
            TTMSG_DAC_ENBL,
            TTMSG_QUIT,
            TTMSG_MAX
          } ttmsgtype;
</PRE>

Replies from ttdriver all begin with the 'tt' signature. With the 
exception of TTMSG_GC_READ and TTMSG_GC_CHAN, every function 
returns an unsigned short value in the value.shrt member of the 
Reply_from_tt structure. TTMSG_GC_CHAN return an unsigned long in 
value.lng. In the case of functions returning unsigned short, a 
value of 0xFFFF is an unambiguous error code. TTMSG_GC_CHAN 
returns ~0L (0xFFFFFFFF) on error.

<PRE>
          typedef struct {
            unsigned short signature; /* 'tt' */
            union {
              unsigned short shrt;
              unsigned long lng;
            } value;
          } Reply_from_tt;
</PRE>

TTMSG_GC_READ returns as much data as the GC board currently has 
available in the gc_data_buf structure. The samples read from the 
board are written sequentially into the samples array. If gcbuf 
is of type gc_data_buf, the samples from channel 0 begin at 
gcbuf.samples[0] and end with 
gcbuf.samples[gcbuf.end_offset[0]-1]. gcbuf.end_offset[0] then 
represents the index of the first sample from channel 1, as well 
as the number of samples which were read from channel 0. The 
number of samples read from channel 1 is gcbuf.end_offset[1] - 
gcbuf.end_offset[0].<P>

In case of error, gcbuf.end_offset[0] will be set to 0xFFFF. 

<PRE>
          typedef struct {
            unsigned short end_offset[ N_GC_CHANNELS ];
            unsigned long samples[ MAX_GC_SAMPLES * N_GC_CHANNELS ];
          } gc_data_buf;

          typedef struct {
            unsigned short signature; /* 'tt' */
            gc_data_buf gcbuf;
          } Reply_from_gc;
</PRE>

There are two message formats which SCDC recognizes. The first is 
for a single command to set or clear a single digital output. The 
command to set a singal digital output is different from the 
command to clear that output. I propose to use the digital output 
channel number as the clear command and the digital output 
channel number plus 100 as the set command.

<PRE>
          typedef struct {
            unsigned char signature[2]; /* DASCMD, DCT_SCDC (1, 3) */
            unsigned char command;
          } Send_to_scdc;
</PRE>

The second message format allows multiple set or clear commands 
to be communicated in a single message, a feature which soldrv 
takes advantage of. The commands array contains a list of command 
codes terminated by 0xFF.

<PRE>
          typedef struct {
            unsigned char signature; /* SC_MULTCMD (11) */
            unsigned char commands[ MAX_MSG_SIZE ];
          } Mult_send_to_scdc;
</PRE>

Both of these messages return a single byte return code defined 
in /usr/local/include/reply.h.<P>
