<h2><a id="P0">0</a>: Introduction</h2>
Cycle is a little language useful for performing calculations
relative to instrument operating cycles. Its function
is to average data over specified regions. Regions are defined
relative to specific Triggers, and Triggers can be defined
based on any data available in the data stream.<P>

Cycle is implemented as a preprocessor for
<a href="tmc.html">TMC</a>. It has a fairly small command set.
The output is code to calculate various data over various time
regions. Unlike the previous version, the current version does
not accept general TMC commands, so code to manipulate the
calculated averages must be placed in another file.<P>

<h2><a id="P1">1</a>: Definitions</h2>

A Cycle program contains definitions for
<a href="#P1.1">Triggers</a>, <a href="#P1.2">Regions</a> and 
<a href="#P1.3">Averages</a>. A <a href="#P1.4">Rate</a> must
also be specified. The usable products are TMC
variables which represent averages of specific input values
over the specified regions.<P>

<h3><a id="P1.1">1.1</a>: Triggers</h3>

Regions are defined with respect to specific Triggers. The
Trigger will define a reference point in time against which
the limits of the Regions will be measured.<P>

A Trigger is specified by name and with a "start condition",
an optional "prestart condition":
<PRE>
        Trigger &lt;NAME&gt; {
          Start: &lt;Expr&gt;;
          [Prestart: &lt;Expr&gt;;]
          &lt;Regions&gt;
        }
</PRE>

The &lt;Expr&gt;s are any TMC logical expression. If no 
Prestart condition is specified, the logical negation of the
Start condition is used. The Trigger becomes valid after the
Prestart condition is met (evaluates to be true) when the
Start condition is met. For example, in the definition:
<PRE>
        Trigger CycleA {
          Start: (DStt0 &amp; 4) != 0;
          ...
        }
</PRE>

in order for Trigger CycleA to become valid, first the condition
!((DStt0 &amp; 4) != 0) must be met, then the condition
(DStt0 &amp; 4) != 0 must be met.<P>

<h3><a id="P1.2">1.2</a>: Regions</h3>

Within a Trigger definition, we can define Regions. A Region can be
defined in two ways: by specifying one or more time intervals
relative to the Trigger time or by specifying explicit
expressions.

<PRE>
        &lt;Regions&gt; ::= &lt;Region&gt;*
        &lt;Region&gt; ::= Region &lt;REGION_NAME&gt; &lt;RegionParams&gt; ';'
        &lt;RegionParams&gt; ::= &lt;Intervals&gt; / &lt;Exprs&gt;

        &lt;Intervals&gt; ::= &lt;Interval&gt; // ','
        &lt;Interval&gt; ::= &lt;Left&gt; &lt;Number&gt; ',' &lt;Number&gt; &lt;Right&gt;
        &lt;Left&gt; ::= '(' / '['
        &lt;Right&gt; ::= ')' / ']'

        &lt;Exprs&gt; ::= [ '=' Expr [ ':' Expr [ ':' Expr ] ] ]
</PRE>

Intervals are specified using the standard mathematical notation
for real-number intervals. For example, (3,5] represents time
elapsed since the trigger of greater than 3 seconds and less than
or equal to 5 seconds. All &lt;Number&gt;s listed in a Region
definition must be non-negative and monotonically increasing.
(SNAFU allows regions to be defined prior to the trigger, but realtime 
constraints make this extremely difficult here.) If multiple
intervals are specified for a single region, they must be
separated by commas and arranged in increasing order. For example:
<PRE>
        Region FG [0.25, 1.625], (3.5, 7.0 ];
</PRE>

Defines a Region named "FG" beginning 0.25 seconds after the
Trigger and ending 1.625 seconds after the Trigger as well as
times greater than 3.5 seconds and less than or equal to 7
seconds.<P>

The explicit expressions give greater flexibility in the
definition of regions, since they may allow regions which are not
of a fixed width or fixed delay relative to the trigger. You may
list 0, 1, 2 or 3 expressions to define a region. The expressions
represent "Inside" points, "Before" points and "After" points.
Data points occuring at times when the Inside expression is true
will be entered into the average. The region will be considered
complete, the average evaluated and the sums reset whenever the
Before or After expressions are true.<P>

It is legal (and reasonable) to have one time evaluate as being
both "Before" and "Inside"; this is the case for a time interval
starting at 0. At T==0, the Before condition is true, so any
outstanding average is completed and evaluated, then since the
Inside condition is also true, the current data point is entered
in as the first value in the next average bin. In this way, it is
possible to average data over the entire Trigger region without
skipping any data points. (This can be specified as a Region with
no intervals and no expressions, e.g.: Region All;)<P>

For reasons that will become apparent shortly, Region names are
best kept short.<P>

Only one Region of a given name should be defined with respect to
a single Trigger, but additional regions of the same name may be
defined with respect to other Triggers.

<h3><a id="P1.3">1.3</a>: Averages</h3>

Now that we have Triggers and Regions defined, we can specify
what to average over that regions:

<PRE>
        &lt;Average&gt; ::= Average [Raw] &lt;AvgVarList&gt; Over &lt;RegionList&gt; ;
</PRE>

For each variable specified, an average is calculated for every
occurance within the specified Regions. The result is stored in
a new variable named by combining the variable's name with the
Region's name. For example:

<PRE>
        Average DetA, DetB Over FG;
</PRE>

will average DetA and DetB over the Region FG and define outputs
DetA_FG and DetB_FG which represent the respective averages
over that region.<P>

Averaging will be performed on converted data unless the 'Raw'
keyword is specified.

<h3><a id="P1.4">1.4</a>: Rate</h3>

One additional detail is required in a Cycle program; you must
specify the rate at which the region limits will be tested.
This is usually the rate of your highest-rate data. (I wish
TMC had an automatic way to determine this, but it doesn't
at this time -N). The rate may either be specified in Hz or as
the name of a TM datum of the desired rate. If no rate is
specified, the rate of the Minor Frame Counter (MFCtr) is used.
This should usually be a good choice, but not always.

<PRE>
        &lt;Rate&gt; ::= Rate &lt;Integer&gt; Hz;
        &lt;Rate&gt; ::= Rate &lt;Integer&gt; / &lt;Integer&gt; Hz;
        &lt;Rate&gt; ::= Rate &lt;Name&gt;;
</PRE>

For example:

<PRE>
        Rate 8 Hz;
        Rate DetA;
</PRE>

<h3><a id="P1.5">1.4</a>: Discard</h3>

It is sometimes convenient to throw out certain data values prior 
to averaging. This can be done using the syntax:

<PRE>
        &lt;Discard&gt; ::= Discard &lt;VarList&gt; ( if / unless )  &lt;Expr&gt;
</PRE>

For example:
<PRE>
        Discard DetA, DetB if (CtStat & 0x8000);
</PRE>

Another approach may be introduced soon.

<h2><a id="P2">2</a>: Implementations</h2>

Once all your definitions are in place, you can begin writing
expressions using the derived averages. This is accomplished by
defining the averages in a .cyc file, then referencing them
in other files.<P>

One very useful feature is that multiple Regions can be defined
with the same name relative to different Triggers. This would
be used, for example, when an instrument has different cycle
lengths which can be determined by a status value at the 
beginning of the cycle:

<PRE>
        Trigger Long {
          Start: (DStt0 & 1) && SolSW == 1;
          Region FG [ 0.25 7.75 ];
          Region BG ( 8.25 15.75 ];
        }

        Trigger Short {
          Start: (DStt0 &amp; 1) && SolSW == 2;
          Region FG [ 0.25 3.75 ];
          Region BG ( 4.25 7.75 ];
        }

        Average DetA, DetB Over FG, BG;
</PRE>

These could then be referenced in a .tmc file:
<PRE>
        double DiffA, DiffB;
        Invalidate DiffA;
        Invalidate DiffB;
        
        { DiffA = DetA_FG - DetA_BG;
          validate DiffA; }
        { DiffB = DetB_FG - DetB_BG;
          validate DiffB; }
</PRE>

In this example, the difference of the foreground and background
averages are calculated for both the short cycle and the long
cycle.<P>

<h2><a id="P3">3</a>: Invocation</h2>

Within the ARP/DAS/appgen environment, Cycle program files have
names ending in ".cyc".  <a href="appgen.html">appgen</a> handles
the invocation of the Cycle preprocessor automatically. This is
certainly the recommended method of invocation.<P>

During alpha and beta testing of version 2, additional commands
must be placed into the .spec file below the "%%":
<PRE>
        CYCLE=cycle > $@
</PRE>
