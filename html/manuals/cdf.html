<H1>CDF Syntax</H1>

<p>Files with a <CODE>.cdf</CODE> extension are used to define 
the extraction of experimental data from the raw data files 
written by the <CODE>lgr</CODE> program to a comma separated
value text file
format, which is more suitable for data analysis. The 
<CODE>edf2ext</CODE> compiler converts these definitions into TMC 
code, which is in turn compiled to C++ and linked into an 
executable which performs the actual extraction.
</P>

<p>A <CODE>.cdf</CODE> file defines extraction to one or more 
output files. Each output file must be identified by name and the 
number of columns. An optional keyword, <CODE>separate</CODE> can 
be added, which is explained later.</p>

<blockquote><code>
  csv &lt;name&gt; &lt;n_columns&gt; [ separate ]
</code></blockquote>

<p>After the spreadsheet is identified, the columns to which data is 
to be extracted are defined:</p>

<blockquote><code>
  &lt;column&gt; &lt;mnemonic&gt; [ &lt;format&gt; ] [ &lt;conversion&gt; ]
</code></blockquote>

<p><CODE>&lt;column&gt;</CODE> is the column number, which must be 
greater than or equal to zero and less than the number of columns in the 
spreadsheet. Column zero always refers to time, but you can use a column
zero definition to specify a different name or output format for the
time variable.</P>

<p><CODE>&lt;mnemonic&gt;</CODE> is the datum mnemonic which must 
correspond to a TMC definition (except in the case of column zero).</P>

<p><CODE>&lt;format&gt;</CODE> is an optional C-style output format to
determine how the data should be converted to text. If no format
is specified, the extraction uses the same text conversion function
used for realtime data display. When a format is specified, the
value is first converted to a double using whatever TMC conversion
was specified, and then the value is converted to text using printf-style
formatting. Therefore the format must be appropriate for a variable
of type double.</P>

<p>In order to avoid generating corrupt csv files, all output text
is passed through a syntax checker. If the text string is determined
to be non-numeric, it is replaced with a string designated for non-numbers.
The default non-number string is '' (empty string), which Matlab
recognizes as a non-number on input. Other programs may look for
a different string (<i>e.g.</i> NaN) or a specific large value
(<i>e.g.</i> 99999). These can be specified with the nan-text
keyword.</p>

<p>Note that we often use TMC conversions that produce non-numeric
output to enhance usability of the data displays. This is a case
where specifying an output format is necessary, or all the values
will be reported as non-numbers. During the extraction, a warning
is issued the first time any column produces a non-numeric value,
so reviewing the extract.log file is a good idea at least the first
few times you run the extraction.</p>

<p><CODE>&lt;conversion&gt;</CODE> is an optional parameter which 
allows you to override the conversion defined for the mnemonic's 
TMC type. This is useful, for example, if you would like to 
extract the raw, unconverted data or use a more sophisticated 
conversion than the one used for realtime display. The conversion
value is treated as a function name, but the substitution is
very crude. For example, to extract unconverted integer values,
you could specify:</P>

<blockquote><code>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;7 Air_T %.0lf 1.0*
</code></blockquote>

<p>Here the conversion 'function' is '1.0*', which would translate
into something like:</p>

<blockquote><code>
  printf("%.0lf", 1.0*(Air_T));
</code></blockquote>

<h2>Special Features</h2>

<p><code>nan-text</code> is used to specify the string used to
replace non-numeric text in the output file. The command is placed
on a line by itself with the unquoted string following it. For
example:</p>

<blockquote><code>
  nan-text NaN
</code></blockquote>

<p>At any point in the file, the keyword <CODE>init_only</CODE> may 
be specified to suppress the generation of the code which places 
each data point into the output file. This is useful when you 
wish to take more direct control of how data is written to the 
file or when multiple numbered files are required 
from a single specification (e.g. one for each scan).</P>

<p>Another method for controlling what data goes into a file
is the <CODE>condition</CODE> keyword. This may be placed on the 
line immediately following the <CODE>csv</CODE> line and includes 
a conditional statement which defines which values should be 
included. For example:</p>

<blockquote><code>
  csv foo 5<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;condition if ( status == 7 )
</code></blockquote>

<p>or</p>

<blockquote><code>
  csv foo 5<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;condition depending on ( SCANNING )
</code></blockquote>

<p>The optional <CODE>separate</CODE> keyword indicates that each 
column should be inserted when it is received independent of the 
rates of the other data in the file. By default, data is 
inserted into the file at the rate of the slowest channel.
When <CODE>separate</CODE> is in effect, 
slower-rate channels will have blank cells when the higher-rate 
data is inserted. This is rarely useful. More commonly, data is 
segregated by rate and then combined as appropriate during
subsequent analysis.</P>
