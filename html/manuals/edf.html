<H1>EDF Syntax</H1>

Files with a <CODE>.edf</CODE> extension are used to define 
the extraction of experimental data from the raw data files 
written by the <CODE>lgr</CODE> program to SNAFU spreadsheet 
format, which is more suitable for data analysis. The 
<CODE>edf2ext</CODE> compiler converts these definitions into TMC 
code, which is in turn compiled to C and linked into an 
executable which performs the actual extraction.
The SNAFU spreadsheet format is not the only possible format for 
data analysis, and creating other methods of extraction is not 
difficult. The <CODE>.tmc</CODE> output from <CODE>edf2ext</CODE> 
can be used as a starting point for the development of 
alternative extractions.<P>

An <CODE>.edf</CODE> file defines extraction to one or more 
spreadsheets. Each spreadsheet must be identified by name and the 
number of columns. An optional keyword, <CODE>separate</CODE> can 
be added, which is explained later.
<PRE>
        spreadsheet &lt;name&gt; &lt;n_columns&gt; [ separate ]
</PRE>
After the spreadsheet is identified, the columns to which data is 
to be extracted are defined:
<PRE>
        &lt;column&gt; &lt;mnemonic&gt; &lt;format&gt; [ &lt;conversion&gt; ]
</PRE>
<CODE>&lt;column&gt;</CODE> is the column number, which must be 
greater than zero and less than the number of columns in the 
spreadsheet. Column zero is reserved for Time.<P>

<CODE>&lt;mnemonic&gt;</CODE> is the datum mnemonic which must 
correspond to a TMC definition.<P>

<CODE>&lt;format&gt;</CODE> is a C-style output format which 
SNAFU can use to display the data. (SNAFU supports some extensions 
to the C formats. Refer to the SNAFU manual for details.)<P>

<CODE>&lt;conversion;&gt;</CODE> is an optional parameter which 
allows you to override the conversion defined for the mnemonic's 
TMC type. This is useful, for example, if you would like to 
extract the raw, unconverted data or use a more sophisticated 
conversion than the one used for realtime display.<P>

At any point in the file, the keyword <CODE>init_only</CODE> may 
be specified to suppress the generation of the code which places 
each data point into the spreadsheet. This is useful when you 
wish to take more direct control of how data is written to the 
spreadsheet or when multiple numbered spreadsheets are required 
from a single specification (e.g. one for each scan).<P>

Another method for controlling what data goes into a spreadsheet 
is the <CODE>condition</CODE> keyword. This may be placed on the 
line immediately following <CODE>spreadsheet</CODE> and includes 
a conditional statement which defines which values should be 
included. For example:

<PRE>
        spreadsheet foo 5
		condition if ( status == 7 )
</PRE>

or

<PRE>
        spreadsheet foo 5
		condition depending on ( SCANNING )
</PRE>

The optional <CODE>separate</CODE> keyword indicates that each 
column should be inserted when it is received independent of the 
rates of the other data in the spreadsheet. By default, data is 
inserted into the spreadsheet at the rate of the slowest channel 
in the spreadsheet. When <CODE>separate</CODE> is in effect, 
slower-rate channels will have blank cells when the higher-rate 
data is inserted. This is rarely useful. More commonly, data is 
segregated by rate and then combined as appropriate using SNAFU's 
merge capabilities.<P>
