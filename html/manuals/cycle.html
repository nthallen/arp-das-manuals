<h2><a id="P0">0</a>: Introduction</h2>
Cycle is a little language useful for performing calculations
relative to instrument operating cycles. Its primary function
is to average data over specified regions. Regions are defined
relative to specific Triggers, and Triggers can be defined
based on any data available in the data stream.<P>

Cycle is implemented as a preprocessor for
<a href="tmc.html">TMC</a>. It has a fairly small command set, but 
any non-Cycle commands are passed through to the output file.
This allows arbitrarily complex TMC or C operations to be
performed using the averages calculated by Cycle.<P>

<h2><a id="P1">1</a>: Definitions</h2>

A Cycle program contains definitions for
<a href="#P1.1">Triggers</a>, <a href="#P1.2">Regions</a> and 
<a href="#P1.3">Averages</a>. A <a href="#P1.4">Rate</a> must
also be specified. The usable products are TMC
variables which represent averages of specific input values
over the specified regions.<P>

<h3><a id="P1.1">1.1</a>: Triggers</h3>

To define a Region, we must first specify a Trigger. The
Trigger will define a reference point in time against which
the limits of the Regions will be measured.<P>

A Trigger is specified by name and with a "start condition" and 
an options "prestart condition":
<pre>
        Trigger &lt;NAME&gt;
        Start &lt;CONDITION&gt;
        Prestart &lt;CONDITION&gt;
</pre>

The &lt;CONDITION&gt;s are any TMC logical expression. If no 
Prestart condition is specified, the logical negation of the
Start condition is used. The Trigger becomes valid after the
Prestart condition is met (evaluates to be true) when the
Start condition is met. For example, in the definition:
<pre>
        Trigger CycleA
        Start (DStt0 &amp; 4) != 0
</pre>

in order for Trigger CycleA to become valid, first the condition
!((DStt0 &amp; 4) != 0) must be met, then the condition
(DStt0 &amp; 4) != 0 must be met.<P>

<h3><a id="P1.2">1.2</a>: Regions</h3>

Once a Trigger is defined, we can define a Region. Regions are
defined relative to the most recently defined Trigger. They are
specified with a name and two times:

<pre>
        Region &lt;REGION_NAME&gt; &lt;SECONDS&gt; &lt;SECONDS&gt;
</pre>

The two &lt;SECONDS&gt; represent the time after the Trigger of
the start and end of the region, respectively. These must both
be non-negative real numbers measured in seconds. (SNAFU allows
regions to be defined prior to the trigger, but realtime 
constraints make this extremely difficult here.) For example:
<pre>
        Region FG 0.25 1.625
</pre>

Defines a Region named "FG" beginning 0.25 seconds after the
Trigger and ending 1.625 seconds after the Trigger. For reasons
that will become apparent shortly, Region names are best kept
short.<P>

<h3><a id="P1.3">1.3</a>: Averages</h3>

Now that we have a Region defined, we can specify what to average
over that region:

<pre>
        Average &lt;REGION_NAME&gt; &lt;var&gt; [ &lt;var&gt; ... ]
</pre>

For each variable specified, an average is calculated for every
occurance within the specified Region. The result is stored in
a new variable named by combining the variable's name with the
Region's name. For example:

<pre>
        Average FG DetA DetB
</pre>

will average DetA and DetB over the Region FG and define outputs
DetA_FG and DetB_FG which represent the respective averages
over that region.<P>

By default, averaging will be performed on unconverted data. 
There are two ways to change this. The first is to explicitly 
specify which variables should be converted before averaging:

<pre>
        Average FG DetA convert(DetB)
</pre>

In this case DetA will be averaged as raw data and DetB will be 
converted before being averaged. The derived average for 
convert(DetB) is designated as DetB_cvt_FG in order to 
distinguish it from a raw average.<P>

The other approach is to simply specify that all averages should 
use converted data using the convert_on keyword. In this case, 
the _cvt suffix is not used and DetB_FG represents the average of 
converted data. It is possible to switch between these two modes 
by alternately specifying convert_on and convert_off.<P>

<h3><a id="P1.4">1.4</a>: Rate</h3>

One additional detail is required in a Cycle program; you must
specify the rate at which the region limits will be tested.
This is usually the rate of your highest-rate data. (I wish
TMC had an automatic way to determine this, but it doesn't
at this time -N).

<pre>
        Rate <a href="tmc.html#rate">&lt;rate&gt;</a>
</pre>

For example:

<pre>
        Rate 8 Hz
</pre>

<h3><a id="P1.5">1.4</a>: Discard</h3>

It is sometimes convenient to throw out certain data values prior 
to averaging. This can be done using the syntax:

<pre>
        Discard &lt;var&gt; [ &lt;var&gt; ... ] unless &lt;condition&gt;
</pre>

Another approach may be introduced soon.

<h2><a id="P2">2</a>: Implementations</h2>

Once all your definitions are in place, you can begin writing
expressions using the derived averages. One approach is to
simply define the averages in a .cyc file, then reference them
in other files. Alternatively, you can carry out your entire
calculation within the .cyc file, producing a single composite
output such as mixing ratio. Either way, you could reference
the resulting values in other files to either display, extract
or even make algorithmic decisions.<P>

One very useful feature is that multiple Regions can be defined
with the same name relative to different Triggers. This would
be used, for example, when an instrument has different cycle
lengths which can be determined by a status value at the 
beginning of the cycle:

<pre>
        Trigger Long
        Start (DStt0 & 1) && SolSW == 1
        Region FG 0.25 7.75
        Region BG 8.25 15.75

        Trigger Short
        Start (DStt0 &amp; 1) && SolSW == 2
        Region FG 0.25 3.75
        Region BG 4.25 7.75

        Average FG DetA DetB
        Average BG DetA DetB

        TM typdef double Diff_t;
        Diff_t DiffA, DiffB;
        
        { DiffA = DetA_FG - DetA_BG;
          validate DiffA; }
        { DiffB = DetB_FG - DetB_BG;
          validate DiffB; }
</pre>

In this example, the difference of the foreground and background
averages are calculated for both the short cycle and the long
cycle.<P>

<h2><a id="P3">3</a>: Invocation</h2>

Within the ARP/DAS/appgen environment, Cycle program files have
names ending in ".cyc".  <a href="appgen.html">appgen</a> handles
the invocation of the Cycle preprocessor automatically. This is
certainly the recommended method of invocation.<P>
